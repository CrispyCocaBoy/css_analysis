We couldn't do this work without your support.**\n\nPROOF: [https://i.redd.it/1f3wjeznm8ia1.jpg](https://i.redd.it/1f3wjeznm8ia1.jpg)\n\nIn the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High massacre in 2018, we reported for the first time how many children had endured a shooting at a K-12 school since 1999, and the final tally was far higher than what we had expected: more than 187,000.\n\nNow, just five years later, and despite a pandemic that closed many campuses for nearly a year, the number has exploded, climbing past 331,000.\n\nWe know that because we’ve continued to maintain a unique database that tracks the total number of children exposed to gun violence at school, as well as other vital details, including the number of people killed and injured, the age, sex, race and gender of the shooters, the types and sources of their weapons, the demographic makeup of the schools, the presence of armed security guards, the random, targeted or accidental nature of the shootings.\n\nSteven is the database editor for the investigations unit at The Washington Post. John Woodrow Cox is an enterprise reporter and the author of Children Under Fire: An American Crisis.\n\nView the Post's database on children and gun violence here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/school-shootings-database/?itid=hp-banner-main](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/school-shootings-database/?itid=hp-banner-main)\n\nRead their full story on what they've learned from this coverage here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/14/school-shootings-parkland-5th-anniversary/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&amp;utm\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/14/school-shootings-parkland-5th-anniversary/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit.com)",

Journalists have come a long way on this issue since Columbine, when many media outlets glamourized the shooters in an irresponsible way. We still feel an obligation to tell people who the shooters are and what motivated the violence. That’s fundamental to the job. But we’re also very careful not to repeat the shooters’ names or publicize their images unnecessarily. And I think it’s made a real difference. Whereas most people could name the Columbine shooters, I doubt many could name the Uvalde or Oxford of Michigan State shooters. That’s the product of media outlets taking a more thoughtful approach to the coverage.",

Fewer casualties almost always result in less media coverage.\n\n\r  \nBased on all my years reporting on this subject, I also believe that shootings in black and brown neighborhoods tend to get less coverage, in general. It shouldn't be that way, because we know that chronic gun violence is, in the long term, more harmful than the one-off shootings that garner so much attention in white communities.",

There is a lot of raw emotion surrounding gun violence. But we cannot make progress on addressing root causes if we are constantly whipped into a hyperbolic frenzy about the gun itself. There are over 600 million guns in the US, and that’s just the ones we can track. Pandora’s box was opened and there’s no going back from it. We need to find ways to work around it and live with them and move forward together, and those solutions do not include getting rid of all the guns.

Bloomberg isn’t shelling out tens of millions and making big public statements about funding veteran support programs or job retraining (though he has enough philanthropic efforts I’m sure he’s got some token thing going around that). \n\nGonna cut myself off here because this is getting long but yeah.

No more law enforcement exemptions. Equal footing across the board. Quit the class warfare. Of law enforcement gets full auto SBRs, so should the average person. Body armor? You betcha. Armored vehicles? Sure, why not. Either we all have access or nobody does. \n\n2. Secure background checks available to all, instantly. It doesn’t have to retain your info, but we live in a day and age where we can pull up medical and criminal records on our phones on the fly - I see no reason we can’t have a system where NICS can be available to everyone, not just FFLs, so that even a private party transfer can have someone input their info and it simply spits out a green light / red light “yes they’re good to go” or “no they’re a prohibited person”. Doesn’t need to track whether or not they already own a gun, doesn’t need to retain information that they just made a purchase, just “at this time this person is good to go.” THAT is a “universal” background check that I think everyone could get on board with, vs the current only-available-to-FFLs system. \n\n3. Reimplement gun safety training in schools. If we can do sex ed, drugs, etc, under the guise of “they’re going to encounter it sooner or later, they should be prepared to understand and know the consequences”, I see no reason not to include basic firearm safety with this. They don’t have to shoot live ammo or blanks or actually get any range time, but SHOULD understand how to safely check to see if a gun is loaded and unload it. They should understand to keep it pointed in a safe direction, keep their finger off the trigger at all times, and assume every gun they encounter is loaded until proven otherwise. It’s not difficult. \n\n4. Take suppressors off the NFA list. It’s only courteous. Or at least allow threaded barrels and such so that they may be rented or freely available for use at practice ranges. Contrary to Hollywood belief suppressed gunshots are still LOUD and recognizable as gunshots. It just lessens the hearing damage and noise pollution from outdoor ranges. \n\n5. If you’re going to insist on licensing, then I’m going to insist on tiered licensing and compromise (speaking to the general “you”, here, not necessarily the person I’m replying to). So for example at tier 1, you have to pass a basic safety test, and then can buy anything up to say, a 9mm semi-auto, a 20ga shotgun (semi or otherwise), or .22 rifle (any kind). Renew every 10 years. Tier 2 might be something like Tier 1 + you can go up to a .44 mag pistol, .30-06 rifle, 12ga shotgun, plus mail order ammo to your house in bulk, etc. Renew every 5 years. Tier 3 is Tier 2 + CCW, NFA items (ie full auto, SBRs, suppressors, etc). Renew every 2 years.",

Quit the shenanigans with treating gun ranges the same way Texas/red states do abortion clinics. I’d rather have people who can aim and hit their target over people who spray and hit bystanders. Most homicides are targeted beef. Let it end with that and not catch 6 other people 100 yards away down the block if someone is pissed off enough to abuse it. I’m not saying gun ranges should be as plentiful as Starbucks, but from a safe use perspective, you shouldn’t have to drive 2 hours away to get some practice in, either. Not everyone has that option. No random requirements that seem reasonable but magically preclude a gun range from operating. \n\n8. Mandatory sunset clauses. If new gun control laws cannot be proven to have had the measurable impact on gun safety they were purported to in order to pass, they get rolled back. Quit piling on when you know it’s not going to do anything. \n\n9. Ease up on the plea bargains. Gun charges for people who have **actually used them to commit crimes from murder to robbery** are often the first thing dropped in sentencing. Fuck that. If you’re going to pound the gun control drum for assault weapons and everything, don’t then turn around and ~~pardon~~ [https://www.turnto23.com/news/crime/bakersfield-family-asks-for-justice-after-gov-newsom-pardons-killer](grant clemency to someone who straight up executed a store clerk with a shotgun blast to the back of the head) while he was already on the ground wounded from the first shot to his back. They shouldn’t be bargaining chips. And I’m not talking about “oh he got a DUI and happened to have a gun in the car”, by all means negotiate on dumb stuff like that where nobody was hurt. But if someone literally killed another person with a gun during a robbery or something…no plea bargain. None. Maaaaaaaybe if they’re giving up a bigger fish, but that’s it. In a similar vein - lying on a background check form 4473 is currently punishable by up to 10 years in jail and a $250,000 fine. Out of hundreds of thousands who have failed their background check, fewer than a couple dozen have actually been charged for it. That’s some really, really low hanging fruit not being enforced. So the fact that we have people clamoring for more laws while ignoring criminals handing themselves to law enforcement on a silver platter just doesn’t make sense to me. \n\n10. Capping this list at 10 for now it’s long enough as it is. I’ve probably managed to upset both some pro-gun people and anti-gun people with this list. That’s fine. That’s how you know it’s actually a compromise. So to finish the list: taxes. Gun control has become (well, maybe always was) a class warfare issue. If you’re wealthy enough, no matter what state you live in, you can get any type of firearm you want. Yes, even in California. And yes, [even tanks](https://www.hemmings.com/stories/2018/08/30/last-of-littlefield-tank-collection-arrives-ahead-of-american-heritage-museums-opening)! Gun control advocates have proposed severely increased taxes and fees on guns, ammunition, and gun parts, ignoring that they’ve already been sharply increased several times in the past. If you think $20 is too much for a voter ID, and impedes the right to vote, then you should also be upset at things like a $200 tax stamp to get a suppressor for a firearm - it’s not even the actual firearm, just a part! When the NFA was passed, if adjusted for inflation it would be like being asked to pay $3500 for a gun part. That puts it squarely out of reach of most lower and even middle class people. Guns are an extension of the right to self defense and bodily autonomy, among other things. Guns are not solely for the wealthy, or for Hollywood. As long as they are manufactured to a certain minimum safety standard, ie don’t go off randomly when dropped or something.",

        "body": "Thanks for the latest. I don’t know how much of the recent shift in proportions can be attributed to normal issues vs pandemic issues though. \n\nOn average, over the last few decades, it has held relatively steady at (rounding for numbers sake) something like:\n\n30k deaths, out of which \n\n20k are suicides\n\n8k are gang related\n\n1k are police involved \n\nLeaving 1k unjustified including mass shootings and the like. \n\nThe numbers HAVE spiked in the last few years. The pandemic has introduced new stressors, there have been more instances of police brutality sparking protests, under the cover of which bad actors have preyed on other innocents, leading to further loss of life. The economy has been all over the place, and loss of job is a pretty common factor in suicide. \n\nAnd yet. From your most recent figures the majority of “gun violence” deaths are STILL suicide. Homicides, even factoring in gang related (and, by the way, [the Guardian link](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/jan/09/special-report-fixing-gun-violence-in-america) on locality bears reposting) still remain relatively low. 25k / 330,000k. \n\nCan we do better? Absolutely. I simply disagree about how we might go about that, and believe that if we campaigned for, funded, and preached about things that would actually move the needle instead of just “rah rah ban guns”, we would have made more significant progress by now. \n\nGun control, imo, is a losing cause, and always has been. I would wager that a significant enough chunk of single issue voters would vote Democrat, if not for gun control, that Democrats would win in an overwhelming landslide in any state or election that wasn’t staunchly a Republican stronghold. And the way they’ve been imploding lately, I would say even those areas might be winnable….if not for gun control. \n\nGun owners are quite possibly THE most diverse voting demographic in the US.

So I don't think that's a particularly good example / template to uphold, despite how often it gets brought up. Like, gun violence in general was already statistically insignificant there, and a single mass shooting was a blip. \n\nAs for semi-auto handguns being overlooked in legislation - they're not overlooked, it's a very intentional part of a disinformation campaign on behalf of gun control groups. \n\nre: rifles / assault weapons that are typically the focus of new gun control laws:\n\n&gt;The term \"assault weapon\" became widely used starting the late 1980s.

Primary among them being the Austin clock tower shooter. \n\nAdditionally, I might point out that California's big thing for gun control is the so-called \"SAFE\" roster and microstamping laws, with the theory being a firing pin will leave a readily-identifiable mark on shell casings left at a crime scene that law enforcement can trace back to the gun owner. Ease of removing said markings aside, this microstamping is completely nullified by simply carrying a revolver, which doesn't automatically eject shell casings as you shoot. \n\nLastly, to address the thought of \"nullifying the idea of carrying a firearm to feel safe\" - carrying a firearm is a whole separate issue from a semi-automatic ban. That being said, semi-automatics tend to be the weapon of choice, so perhaps there's at least more of a (tenuous) link between those than your other points. \n\nBonus: [Mother shoots home invader 5x in the face with a revolver](https://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-mom-hiding-kids-shoots-intruder/story?id=18164812), but :\n\n&gt;\\[he\\] managed to get to his car and as he tried to flee, crashed into a tree.

Police take, on average, 11 minutes to respond and have less knowledge of what is going on than those already at the scene. These steps would help prevent violent crime in and out of schools while still respecting and protecting the rights of average citizens. ",
