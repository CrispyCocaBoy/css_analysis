        "body": "&gt; ...exists so that as a last resort people might rebel...\n\nThis doesn't tend to be backed up in writings of the authors of the Constitution between one another. Their focus was more on the dangers of a standing professional army (much like the one we have today) and the ability to mobilize such an army in order to defend western frontiers, which they knew would soon be under threat for encroaching into native American territories. Territories promised by the British Crown to remain under indigenous control.  \nMany of the authors of the Constitution, leaders of the Revolution, had ties to land speculation in the Ohio territory and west of the Appalachians, land in which the British Army would not offer any protection. But a standing army was seen as a marker of tyranny, especially since they had all gone to great efforts to highlight it as such.  \nSo what was needed was a way to ensure the land would remain protected, without the need for a standing army. Without the need to pay and feed troops in perpetuity. What better way than to make it clear that all citizens have the right to arm themselves in the formation of militias? Militias which could be rallied overnight to strike back at native villages and secure new lands with force.\n\nI think it's also useful to look at how the early administrations of the US responded to rebellions, uprisings or revolutionary moments. The Whiskey Rebellion is a handy example, though it ends rather anti-climatically. The short version is that frontiersmen were upset about a tax implemented under Washington's administration—or, wait, wasn't no taxes something this country was \"founded on\"—and they refused to pay. They gathered in arms and threatened government tax collectors and President Washington responded by leading an army of 13,000 troops (a drafted army, at that, wasn't there something about conscription being bad... I can't remember) to face some 2000-odd rebels. Here was a man largely seen as the center of the Constitutional Convention and *he* was saying, in his actions, that an act of rebellion against the government (arguably an act similar to that which led to the independence of the country he now presides over) is unacceptable. Hamilton, as well, his Treasury Secretary, pushed hard for any and all captured rebels to be tried for treason and hanged. He was quite disappointed when Washington later pardoned the two men found guilty of treason before they could be hanged.\n\nSimilar, too, is the Civil War. Though Lincoln and his cabinet had nothing to do with the writing of the Constitution. It serves as an example that the government's stance, despite being guided by the founding document, is not one that says citizens have a right to attempt to overthrow their government. The US Government has always acted to preserve its own power and authority over its citizenry.\n\nAll of this is to say that is you *want* to own a gun for the purpose of repelling government, that's fine and dandy, but **the government** is never going to approve of that justification. The government seeks to protect and strengthen itself. Gun ownership (legal or otherwise) is a danger to the citizens of a nation, not to the government of that nation, otherwise this issue of the second amendment would have been taken care of after the Civil War. Note that in none of these occasions did anyone argue that the *guns* were the problem, but the *rebelling* was the problem.  \nI'm not telling you to give up your gun or to make any pleas for \"common sense\" reforms (which is the emptiest rhetoric I've EVER heard). Hell, I'm right there with you. Let's all get guns and convince our military buddies to jump ship and let's overthrow the state and have a truly liberal society free from the tyranny of government.  \nBut let's not delude ourselves thinking that any governing document grants us any rights with the intention of rebellion.  \nI'll leave you with the words of Samuel Adams, which he wrote during [Shay's Rebellion](http://shaysrebellion.stcc.edu/shaysapp/person.do?shortName=samuel_adams):  \n&gt; in monarchies the crime of treason and rebellion may admit of being pardoned or lightly punished, but the man who dares rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death.",

The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive.\n\nBut really, when he says that the tree of liberty must be refreshed, what's he talking about?  \nWell, as it turns out, he's talking about the blood of rebels.  \n&gt; We have had 13 states independent 11 years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century &amp; a half for each state.\n\nAlright, I'm not really a fan of this kinda math, but I see the point he's making. So, how does this connect to watering trees with blood?  \n&gt; what country before ever existed a century &amp; half without a rebellion &amp; what country can preserve it’s liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms.\n\nHe's saying the independent states have done such a great job that they're only had *one* rebellion in his calculated 143 years of rule. It's worth a mention, though, that for him to see 11 years of 13 states he would have to start counting from the beginning of the Revolutionary War. And that seems a little unfair. The war ended just four years prior to this letter, which means, by his math, the states saw one rebellion in 54 years of peaceful rule. The rebellion he's referring to is Shay's Rebellion.  \nBut anyway, the new states are awesome, and can also totally handle whatever pitiful little rebellion of uninformed people may rise up to show how feisty they are. He then continues to your favorite part:  \n&gt; The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon &amp; pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots &amp; tyrants. It is it’s natural manure.\n\n\"Set them right as to facts,\" being to suppress the rebellion as governments do. And who cares if some rebels (and possibly some soldiers) die in the process? Keep in mind that with the context of the rebels being uninformed, they're likely the tyrants he's referring to. And even if he's not calling the rebels tyrants, if they're the patriots, the rest of the context clearly doesn't support a government overthrow. He says the *remedy* is to *pacify* them.  \nI think it's pretty clear in the whole context of the letter that Jefferson was mostly shrugging at Shay's Rebellion, saying it wasn't a big deal and that, really, things were going mostly alright in these new states.",

He is charged with culpable negligence and child neglect - both of which are going to be very hard to pin on a school resource officer.\n\n[Culpable negligence](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.05.html) requires the state to prove that the defendant either exposed a victim to personal injury or personally inflicted that injury through negligence. This might apply if, for example, the resource officer was in charge of locking all the doors in the school and the shooter walked through a door that was left unlocked. There may be such factors that haven't been released to the public, but based on the info we currently have I don't think that applies to this situation. Culpable negligence is often loosely defined as \"failing to act when a reasonable person would have\", so the burden also lies on the state to prove that a \"reasonable person\" would have confronted an active shooter even at risk of their own life. \n\nThe [child neglect](https://m.flsenate.gov/Statutes/827.03) charge is even harder to make a case for, as the state would need to prove that the resource officer was somehow directly responsible for the well-being of the children and could be legally defined as a \"caregiver\". The administration of the school or even the individual teachers fit this definition much more closely than a school resource officer - at least in legal precedent.\n\nI do think the cases I cited above may be grounds for dismissal of the lawsuits against him, since as you pointed out they are rulings in civil cases.",

The boys have since been arrested, but what really sticks out to me in the article is this section: \n\n&gt; According to Brevard School District officials, the Titusville school investigated a possible threat on Jan. 10, 2017, after an art teacher at the school and other students told administrators that one of the two students was threatening to shoot people.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to a police report, the student told classmates that he was going to shoot his art teacher and hide explosives in the classroom. The report said he boasted students in the art room would \"be killed first\" and that he would use X-ACTO knives from the art room to stab them before turning a blade on himself. \n&gt; \n&gt; District spokesman Matt Reed said an initial internal investigation by the school, consisting of a few hours of questioning by the Astronaut guidance counselor and vice principal, cleared the student of any suspicions.\n&gt; \n&gt; School officials are trained to ask questions \"meant to reveal warning signs of mental illness, a desire to do harm or the means to hurt others,\" Reed said. The vice principal and counselor also interviewed some students who had overheard the threatening remarks. \n&gt;\n&gt; The guidance counselor at Astronaut, Monique Muldowney, told the art teacher via email that, after talking to the student, she did not believe the boy was threat. Vice Principal Jamie Russell told investigators \"he was typical goofy kid who wants attention and he did not believe the threats were that serious.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The art teacher responded saying the student has easy access to sharp objects in the class, and \"if he mentions anything of the sort again, I would like him out with no questions.\" \n&gt; \n&gt; School officials did not tell district staff or its assigned security resource officer about the incident, and did not search the student's locker or backpack. The student did not have a history of disciplinary problems, according to the school district.\n&gt; \n&gt; “At the time, it was not protocol to notify police or the security resource officer. Today, it is,” Reed said, explaining that any perceived threat is now reported to police. \n&gt; \n&gt; By chance, Reed said, a few days later, the teacher who reported the incident mentioned it to her husband who worked at Parrish Medical Center, where a shooting had unfolded the year before, and he contacted the Titusville Police Department with the alleged threat.",
