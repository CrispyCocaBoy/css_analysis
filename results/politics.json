        "body": "So I'm confused about so much more than what is said in this article. \n\nA grand jury was created to investigate the Parkland High School shooting.  Okay fine.   It's not inconceivable that someone would want to know whether there was a failure of administration that led to the shooting and whether someone could be charged. But it is notable that the decision to create the grand jury would have been made by a republican, and the school administration is mostly democratic.\n\nThe grand jury apparently doesn't pursue any criminal charges, but releases a report on its findings. That's weird because that's not what grand juries do.  In any case the report is confidential because all documents related to grand juries are confidential. \n\nThis report finds that there was negligence and incompetence among School Board Administration in Broward county.  But didn't recommend charges. Again very weird. \n\nThis report was released in April of 2021.  No actions were taken. \n\nBut in August of 2022, 60 days before an election,   the governor unseals a report and dismisses four members of the school board named as having been incompetent.   \n\nImportantly he does this while a jury is actually deliberating on the fate of the shooter.\n\nHe does nominally have the power to dismiss public officials who have committed a gross breach of Duty, but the timing is bizarre and just not referenced in the article. \n \nAnd now he can appoint four Replacements to an otherwise Democratic majority School board.   Again, allowed under the law but very unusual.",

There’s a huge class divide in the justice system, where wealthy or elites can ignore subpoenas, remain free under trial, or simply get light sentences or pardoned altogether. These things erode the ability of a democracy to function because there is little motivation to not abuse the system. \n\nFurthermore, the country is divided. One side actively wishes for the destruction of democracy, while the other side is continually accused of wishing the destruction of democracy. These two opposing views are at odds and will crash at a head if the system breaks down, because the side in support of democracy will have to take to the streets, which will only justify violence from the other side.",

But also, the republican constituents are short sighted and largely evil in aggregate too, but they are still people that have \"the right desire\" to do good, they are simply too easy to manipulate and beguile (calling it guile is generous). They are also deeply selfish and myopic when it comes to how society is the fabric of their very lives, yet they undermine it constantly thinking they can independently thrive on their own (as though roads, bridges, cars, electricity, and so on, happened and will continue to happen without the intervention of a logical government).",

Each state does it differently with some having an independent commission doing it to lessen gerrymandering while others are made by the state legislature. There are also some rules that must be followed to make sure districts aren’t being drawn to exclude minorities. Like let’s say one area is a majority African American and the population is big enough to warrant its own district, the lines can’t be drawn in a way to break it up and split that population up into say four districts, because that would be discrimination. The biggest issue right now is the amount of gerrymandering and the fact that some legislatures have found out that there aren’t really consequences for drawing unconstitutional districts. The court system is supposed to send the map back if it has issues, but nothing is stopping the legislature from sending the same map back with some slight changes that don’t address the issue. Eventually the election comes and a map has to be used, and guess what the only one available is.\n\nEdit: 435 instead of 385 members in the House.",

It all overlaps.\n\nMost of the time when people are talking about millenials, its really gen z.",

When I was in high school in the 80s we had an Amnesty International club where we were involved in activism against apartheid and Leonard Peltier's imprisonment, so we could see what was going on with Reagan, but there wasn't anywhere *near* enough of us to make a difference. Especially when the things we hated were so abstract and there wasn't any one spark to get everybody involved. High school kids today have so many other tools at their disposal that we never dreamed of, and they're using absolutely all of them at once.

I'll say this: these are among *my* values, which also include compassion, empathy, responsibility, accountability, statesmanship, charity, individualism, and citizenship (that is, acting like a member of the citizenry). Also throw in the Boy Scout pledge for good measure. Good luck agreeing which political bucket all these are supposed to fall in. And above all, be good humans. I'm counting on you.",

        "body": "True. However, studies show that it takes one or two generations for a fundamental cultural shift. Start out in schools with therapists directly working with kids - help the bullied kid to not internalize the abuse they're receiving so that it doesn't affect their self image; help the bully work through whatever it is that is driving them to lash out at those around them. Work with the kid who is posting pictures of dead animals to their instagram. Not all kids will accept therapy since their parents will be against it, but once those kids who did accept the help that therapy can give grow up, we'll have a much larger portion of well balanced adults. People who didn't receive therapy when they were a child might look at how well-balanced their neighbor is, and wish that they had been more accepting of therapy earlier. We'll have a larger portion of adults who don't have a stigma around therapy, and they'll raise their children that way. Positive feedback loop.\n\nI'd also like to raise another point: there are many people who claim that gun control doesn't work. Fine. So what is it that drives such a frightening number of people to lethal violence in our country that doesn't exist in other countries? What is different about our country compared to other western cultures like Canada or England? If it's not the access to firearms, then surely it must be that there is a sickness lurking at the heart of our society. We must do everything we can to cure this sickness, and I think both mental health care and education are the most powerful tools when can bring to bear against it.",

That includes a guy who committed suicide in a school parking lot, a gang fight down the block from a college where one bullet landed in a dorm room (nobody was injured), and several other similar incidents.  \n\nMotherJones (NOT a NRA mouthpiece) looked at this tactic back in 2015:  \n[No, there were not 355 mass shootings this year](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/12/no-there-were-not-355-mass-shootings-this-year/)\n\n&gt; According to CNN From 2001 - 2014 there was 440,095 deaths from Gun Violence  \n\nThat includes suicides.  Suicides FAR outnumber gun homicides.  Per FBI UCR there are about 8000-10000 firearm murders in the US each year, plus another ~20k suicides.  To call people who kill themselves 'victims of gun violence' is totally misleading.  \n\nWhichever side of the gun debate you're on, it's important to use good data.  \n\n",

It also gives kids holes they can go down where they rarely go outside and try to make new friends (even when I wasn't coming out of my room while playing WoW at 14, I was still making friends on there, and I had friends IRL who played with me).

Look I can side with the argument that more background checks and limiting firearm sales probably wouldn't stop the problem. Most of these shooters are using someone else's gun. I believe the solution lies with accountability. My guns are all in a safe that ONLY I know the combination to, all have a trigger lock, with keys that ONLY I have. If my wife or child or a friend wants to use one, that's fine, but I'll be with them and ensure they use it responsibly. If all gun owners all had this mentality, I guarantee there would be a significant drop in these shootings. First step is openly talking about the issue and then potentially implementing harsh criminal penalties to anyone whose firearm is used in any form of illegal activity. Most importanly allocate some money towards educating  consumers on safely guarding their guns from even friends and family. Unfortunately Republicans don't even want to talk about it for fear of backlash from their constituents and donors, so instead we get thoughts and prayers and the clock is reset anxiously awaiting the next incident.\n\nIf people guarded their firearms as well as they  guard their atm pins, alot of this problem would correct itself.",

It's why an entire generation is repulsed by the word \"socialism\" meaning we can't have universal healthcare and not be burdened for life for choosing to go to college.\n\nBut I guess there's one thing we don't fear. We don't fear gun violence. Columbine didn't make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Aurora didn't make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Virginia Tech didn't make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Fucking Sandy Hook didn't make us afraid enough. Las Vegas didn't make us afraid enough. Parkland, Florida won't either. \n\nBecause the fear of more restrictions on gun rights is greater than the fear of a gun's right to restrict life I guess.\n\nSo. Is this what the fuck America is?  Have we, particularly those on the right, decided that we need to be constantly afraid, clutching to our AR-15s against mostly imaginary and vastly overblown threats, while the REAL threat, the merchants feeding you this fear and paranoia, drag us further into the dark?  \n\nWe really are a pathetic joke at this point.",

In fact, it's 2 of them:\n\n* It's illegal to sell a handgun to someone from out of state\n* It's illegal to execute a straw purchase on behalf of someone who is not allowed to have a gun\n\nThe problem with universal licensing / registration to ensuring criminals participate in either part. Here are the reasons this solution doesn't address illegal sales:\n\n* Once a gun is re-sold, how will it variably be tracked?\n* How will illegal resale be enforced if straw purchase is not enforced today?\n* If dealers are willing to break the current laws (federal felony) what new disensentives are being created to keep them from being new federal felonies\n* How will lost/stolen guns be treated/tracked? How can you enforce this without punishing a victim of a crime?\n\nAnd there are additional problems with the hypothesis that lax gun laws, or more specifically, the ease with which to get guns, are what is to blame for crime, and it's that there appears to be no relationship in real life.\n\n[This chart outlines homicide rates in large US cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_crime_rate).\n\nIf lax laws means high murder rates, why is Houston, the 4th biggest city, have a homicide rate that is 10 basis points lower than Chicago? If this is a question of ease of access, why does a city of the same size of Chicago have 350 fewer murders a year if the key driver here is easy access to guns?\n\nWhy does Austin, in Texas, have a homicide rate that's only 1 basis point higher than Honolulu, in Hawaii? Those are on the opposite ends of the gun law spectrum, but have very similar homicide rates. The effective deterrent effective of all of Hawaii's cumulative gun control measures is **literally** 1 person a year. \n\nThe opposite also holds true: St. Louis (319,000) has a homicide rate of 49.8, while Lexington (314,000) has a homicide rate of 4.8. Both states have very lax gun control policy, so why is St. Louis's homicide rate 45 basis points higher? Why were there only 5 more total murders in Lexington, Kentucky than there were in Riverside, California, where gun control is much more strict?\n\nTo me, it's clear that this has nothing to do with access to guns and everything to do with intentions of the gun user.

It's about emotion.  Large capacity assault-type weapons are scary, and your movement is based on fear, not on logic, so you go after what scares you the most, rather than what is actually the most impacting.\n\nIf you want to ban \"scary looking guns,\" and you get the majority of legislators to agree with you, you'll prevent the use of AR-15 type weapons from taking about 100 lives per year.  We can't know if those same lives will simply be taken by Glock 19s or Colt M1911s, instead, though.  Opportunity costs notwithstanding, it's very possible that you won't save a single life, just shift which weapon is used to commit the homicides.\n\nIf you manage to make every single privately owned firearm in the US illegal, you'll likely save a few thousand lives.  Out of the 33,000 lives that are lost using the firearm as a tool, (20,000 of those being suicides), maybe a third would live instead.  That's a worthy goal but at what cost?\n\nSwitching to AI driven cars will save as many, or more, by making it ilegal to drive one's car.

Even if the FMR didn't apply, it's still likely going to be first-degree because the intent to kill the witness is still there. What the FMR does is it transfers the intent to commit the felony to any consequence of their felonious conduct (in this case, murder).\n\nYour example is still accurate.  If the surviving robber were to escape and hold out for a while, the only murder they could be charged with would be their accomplice's.

I don't think we can win the gun control fight through the means we have available though. There are just too many people against it and too much money in the fight. I'm trying to find other ways to tackle the issue. ",

Most of the 5 had to do with someone on campus with a gun, and it is unknown if there was any intent to commit a \"school shooting\" in line with the definition of what everyone is debating about. Unless, of course, the definition of what we're discussing is any shooting for any reason that happens on or near school property. This isn't semantics. This is gross exaggeration. \n\n\nThis is irresponsible, sensationalist journalism at its worst, with an obvious bias. The writers correctly assume that most people aren't going to actually read the details in the article, and the soundbite of the headline \"17 school shootings since xyz\" is all that will stick in the \"readers\" head. It's disgusting, and quite frankly a pathetic excuse for journalism. It is very obvious that the majority of these 17 \"school shootings\" were nothing of the sort,  and the writer is pulling shit out his ass to pad his article. \n\n\nThat being said, I have no problem with increased security and regulations around obtaining a firearm legally. Anyone with a history of mental illness, in which the illness can cause violent or irrational behavior, or anyone currently on psych meds that have side effects that can cause violent, irrational behavior, should automatically be disqualified from gun ownership.\n\n\nI also have no problem with slightly more rigorous testing, both written, and physical demonstration of firearm knowledge and safety, before being able to own a gun.\n\n\nLastly, in a related debate, banning \"semiautomatic assault weapons\" does not make any sense. For those of you who are not knowledgeable of firearms, this would still leave equally as powerful weapons on the shelves. Example: the ruger mini 14. A hunting and \"ranch rifle\". Literally the only differences between that and the dreaded (/s) AR15, are some plastic parts, hand grips, and small parts that attach to the end of the barrel. None of which affect the \"deadliness\" of the gun. They shoot the same caliber round, at the same velocity, with a difference of only fractions of a second in how quickly each round can be fired. Also, the vast majority of legitimate school shootings that happen involve pistols. Rifles are the minority in school shootings, as well as violent guncrime in general.",

I didn’t know I had that much blood. The doctors later told me that the ear is a place that is a very bloody place if you’re going to get hit. But in this case, it was probably the best alternative you could even think about, because it went at the right angle, and it was a hard hit. It was very, I guess you say surreal, but it wasn’t surreal. I was telling somebody, you have instances like this or a lot less than this, where you feel it’s a surreal situation. And I never felt that way. I knew immediately that it was a bullet. I knew immediately that it was at the ear, and because it hit very hard, but it hit the ear.\n\nAnd I also heard people shout, “Bullets, bullets. Get down, get down.” Because I moved down pretty nicely, pretty quickly, and we had bullets flying right over my head after I went down. So I’m glad I went down. The bigger miracle was that I was looking in the exact direction of the shooter, and so it hit me at an angle that was far less destructive than any other angle. So that was the miracle.\n\nElon Musk (03:45):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (03:45):\n\nFor those people that don’t believe in God, I think we got to all start thinking about that. You have to.

But it was amazing that I happened to be turned just at that perfect angle. And all because I put down a chart on immigration that showed that the numbers was so great. I love that chart even more now.\n\nElon Musk (04:12):\n\nI mean, maybe it’s a sign. Maybe that’s a sign.\n\nDonald Trump (04:14):\n\nIt’s an immigration sign.\n\nElon Musk (04:17):\n\nYou highlighted a serious issue, and at that moment, the bullet hit your ear, but missed your head. I mean-\n\nDonald Trump (04:27):\n\nWell, the amazing thing is that the sign, I said, “Bring down that sign on immigration.” And it was literally about an eighth of a second where it would be good. And after that, it was going to be a disaster no matter which way you were facing. But it just had that perfect angle, which was exactly at this shooter. Very sad situation. Such a sad situation. As you know, we lost somebody that was great. Cory, a firefighter, a great gentleman, a great Trumper. He was just a fantastic family and a fantastic man. And a friend of mine came up, Elon, and said, “I’d like to give the family some kind of help.” And I said, “That’s great.” He said, “Do you mind?” I said, “I don’t mind at all.” And he wrote out a check for a million dollars. Gave it to the wife, and she said, “This is really nice, but I’d rather have my husband back.” Which is a nice thing for somebody to say, to be honest. She’s great. The family is great.\n\nElon Musk (05:24):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (05:24):\n\nAnd we raised a lot of money for them and for two other gentlemen are unbelievable people also. They were hit really badly. They thought they were not going to make it, and they did. The doctors in the Butler area, I tell you, they were incredible. They saved the two, and they were really hit tough, both of them equally.\n\nElon Musk (05:45):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (05:45):\n\nAnd my first question was, because I heard bullets flying over me and I said, “How many people were killed?” Because we had a massive crowd there, a tremendous, thousands and thousands of people. And there was no land. It was all people. So I said, “How many people have been killed?” Because I knew there were other shots being fired. And they said, “We don’t know yet, but some people have been badly hurt.” I have to give the Secret Service sniper, they call him or sharpshooter, but sniper.\n\nElon Musk (06:15):\n\nYeah.\n\nDonald Trump (06:15):\n\nBecause he didn’t know there was a problem. He’s an extraordinary shot, obviously. And he didn’t know there was a problem, and he was able to pick it all out within five seconds. And he used one bullet from very far away, I guess probably about 400 yards. The shooter was 130, but he was on the opposite side of the field and the podium. And he saw the smoke and the flame from the gun, immediately recognized it, and immediately took a shot. And it was one perfect shot from very far away. And if he didn’t do that, Elon, I mean, a lot more people could have been badly hurt and killed.",

There’s no need for me to stay, here’s my legislative aide who will meet with you all. It doesn’t matter anyway, I’ve made up my mind on all the important topics.” \n\nHe took no questions, had no additional dialog, and just left the room.

Unfortunately, the reality is that many departments are understaffed, especially in those areas that they are needed most, and they have to make tough calls on where to go when.\n\nThe second is we don't want officer's actions constantly guided by the fear of lawsuit.  When responding to a dangerous situation, we don't want the officer to act on a fear of potentially being sued if he or she makes the \"wrong\" decision.  Instead, it should be based on their training and analysis of the situation at hand and free from external distraction.\n\nOf course there are going to be outlier cases where these two concerns don't seem to play a role.

Military bases have a lot of guns in vaults, but aside from Military Police, people typically aren't allowed to carry guns. Only in 2016 did the Pentagon permit military personnel to carry private sidearms, subject to the approval of their Commanding Officer.\n\nEdit:\nMilitary bases have more GGWGs than most other places, but in the context of the GGWG theory, they don't have *that* many more. As many people have pointed out, one shooter can do a ton of damage even if the GGWGs respond to it right away. At Ford Hood, Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and injured 32 more in 10 minutes, even though nearby police responded to it right away, because the GGWG response time on a military base is not meaningfully different than the response time in most civilian settings.\n\nTrue believers in the GGWG theory would say that *every* law-abiding citizen should have guns, so that the response time is immediate. So the argument that\n\n&gt;the GGWG theory is dumb because military bases have more GGWGs yet still suffer from shootings\n\nwould not convince them. They would say that, if only everyone at Ford Hood was armed, Hasan would've been stopped before he did much damage.\n\nTo be clear, I am **not** one of those true believers in the GGWG theory. I think it would be completely insane and impossible to equip everyone with guns; the rational thing to do is to restrict everyone's access to guns.\n\nI was just pointing out that\n\n(a) saying military bases have more GGWGs isn't really a valid counter-argument to the GGWG theory, since the GGWG theory demands almost-universal possession of guns by good guys, not just a few more;\n\n(b) the average military personnel is not allowed to carry guns, in case civilians who read that comment think they are.",

Constable Son was stationed at the front entrance when he spotted the man entering with a concealed rifle. The constable lunged to gain control of the firearm, but it discharged and struck him in the leg. Drawn to the Rotunda by the noise, Corporal Malo and Constable Thom took cover and exchanged several rounds with the gunman after he entered the building. Constable Létourneau tracked the gunman down the Hall of Honour toward the Library of Parliament and fired at him several times. RCMP Sergeant Rozon, Corporal Daigle and constables Barrett, Bergeron, Bubelis, Célestin, Fraser, Marcoux, Palmer, Ruest and Waye, who had assembled outside the Peace Tower, entered the Centre Block. Supported by their colleagues, Sergeant Rozon, Corporal Daigle and constables Barrett and Fraser assumed a tactical formation (IARD) as they charged down the Hall of Honour. With the shooter now cornered in an alcove leading to the Library, Sergeant-at-Arms Vickers, after being advised of the shooter’s location, dove to the floor in front of him and fired his weapon. RCMP Constable Barrett walked directly toward the gunman while also firing his weapon. The collective actions of these 16 individuals brought the incident to an end in less than three minutes, and avoided further tragedy.",

Keep in mind, this place was about the size of a football field and had only about a 6 foot wall for a perimeter. I was in a small makeshift wooden building on the side of the FOB, unable to see outside at the time. The explosion and following report from the small arms fire was so out-of-the-blue for me, even in a combat zone, that I didn't even realize we had been attacked until well after it was over. It's difficult to describe what I thought it was at the time, like a generator had exploded and the automatic fire was reverberating metal from the force of it or something. At any rate, I was trained to use my weapon, which was always in \"amber\" status on that FOB, (full magazine, but bolt forward with no round in the chamber) but I was not ready to even recognize the threat, much less respond to it. To say that any teacher would be able to react in a cool manner and neutralize a threat in a learning environment where such a change in the environment would shock the system in such a way as to render someone almost incapable of moving is ridiculous. Maybe after 3 or 4 attacks on the same school would someone be ready to respond appropriately.",

Historians recount that what made Wyatt earp special wasn't that he was some fast on the draw gunslinger like you see in the movies but rather he had this incredibly rare ability to remain calm in a gun fight.  It was this that gave him a distinct advantage.\n\n  Even out in the open and in more than one shootout Wyatt Earp was able to calmly take aim and fire upon his opponents.  His opponents maybe seeking cover just didn't usually have the same nerves.  So even at close distances they'd miss or shoot more haphazardly.  That's what made him a legend.  I guess having balls of steel.\n\nBut Earp was a complete outlier in his ability to remain calm.  Even others who had experienced shootouts couldn't just stand out in the open and calmly take aim as bullets whizzed past them.  And that's the truth with all of humanity.  Most of us have this fear of dying and inherently dangerous situations.  Some like Earp can place it out of their mind and do the job they need to.  No amount of training can prepare one I don't think to overcome these instincts.  They can lessen them to some degree but people are only human.\n\nI think most studies have shown when confronted with an armed assailant even those who are armed themselves  tend to react instinctively to either take cover or flee.  Many and perhaps most don't even think about returning fire.  Many don't even consider that they might have the possibility.  That's because it's pure instinct kicking in to survive and in such situations most don't think or plan out their actions.  \n\nOn top of that most don't have the time to react if they wanted when surprised by an assailant.  Even if they did remain calm and reach for their weapon they're often too late.  The person planning on killing others by surprise has a very distinct advantage.  Add to that most also won't shoot very well because they're acting defensively and too nervous and you have a very uneven gunfight.\n\nThat being said guns carried by people have saved lives in the past.  An armed teacher might stop a killer short of killing more.  But that teacher might shoot other by mistake.  That teacher my accidentally shoot another not during a killing spree.  That gun might get stolen.  That gun might cause all forms of terrible trauma.  It's a stupid idea that what we need are more guns.  The one thing we seem to know for sure is that the more guns there are floating around in society the more people get hurt or die from them.  In fact when the settlers first started crossing over to the west they'd heard terrible stories about native Americans and armed themselves to the tit.  There were far more deaths from settlers accidentally shooting themselves crossing the country than anything that ever came close to an attack from a native American tribe.  Guns are dangerous we don't need more of them.\n\nAnd so knowing the inherent danger excess guns pose to society that's why men like Wyatt Earp would ask those who were armed to turn over their guns while in town.  That's what he was doing in the gunfight at the O.K. corral, attempting at first to disarm the cowboys.",

First of all, policing is a profession for some and a lifestyle for others. I don't think anyone becomes a police officer thinking that they won't go -and get that shooter, but many don't. \n\nI ran past officers into the building and they were seriously frozen in fear. They couldn't get out of a sentence or process what was happening. Some of these guys were badass officers on the street. For me, everything felt fake. Even as I was stepping over bodies looking for the one or more gunmen, it felt like a super realistic training scenario. It was loud but I couldn't hear anything. Every corner I took I could've been killed, but it just didn't seem real. I wasn't thinking about my wife or my family, just looking for the shooter. That is something that not everyone can turn on and off and frankly unsettling looking back. \n\nI knew i needed to go in. I couldn't let my coworkers down and I couldn't let the people inside down.  When I first went inside i made peace with the fact that this was probably it and that's the last I thought about it. I couldn't have lived with myself if I didn't go in and this shooting didn't even involve kids. That would've been way tougher. \n\nI don't blame this officer for not going in. You go in to that building expecting to die. You follow the sound of the gunshots right into the fight. He probably has a better gun and more ammo. Our bulletproof vests can't even slow down what some of these shooters are shooting. You really don't know if you have it in you until you're in the situation. \n\n",

We would round corners, find an armed individual, not knowing if they are the shooter, and have a verbal or physical standoff.

The chances of me being able to successfully run into a building, assess the situation, locate the shooter, and stop the threat are a lot lower than the chances of me running into the building, becoming a part of the confusion because another individual has appeared with a gun, maybe sending students running back towards the shooter or myself accidentally shooting an unarmed student.  Ive always known this. Ive always heard this discussed in groups of like minded individuals who carry for self defense.  To hear the NRA now use this idea shows me what Ive always known, the NRA doesn’t represent responsible gun owners. They represent gun manufactures and it just so happens their interests align with gun owners. \n\nArming teachers, while at the surface, can appear like a good idea to prevent this violence, its not.

My interest was initially accidental.  I discovered an untold story of massive scale and consequence as a result of initial research into Trayvon Martin and his High School life.\n\n&gt;4.  What I stumbled upon was a Broward County law enforcement system in a state of conflict.  The Broward County School Board and District Superintendent, entered into a political agreement with Broward County Law enforcement officials to stop arresting students for crimes.\n\n&gt;5. The motive was simple.  The school system administrators wanted to \"improve their statistics\" and gain state and federal grant money for improvements therein.\n\n&gt;6.  So police officials, the very highest officials of law enforcement (Sheriff and Police Chiefs), entered into a plan.\n&gt;7.  As soon as Miami-Dade began to receive the benefits (political and financial) from the scheme, Broward County joined on.  The approach in Broward was identical as the approach in Miami-Dade.\n&gt;8.  It's important to remember, this was not an arbitrary change - this was a well-planned fundamental shift in the entire dynamic of how teenagers would be treated when they engaged in criminal conduct.\n&gt;9.  The primary problem was the policy conflicted with laws; and over time the policy began to create outcomes where illegal behavior by students was essentially unchecked by law enforcement.\n&gt;10.  Initially the police were excusing misdemeanor behaviors.  However, it didn't take long until felonies, even violent felonies (armed robberies, assaults and worse) were being excused.\n&gt;11.  The need to continue lowering the arrests year-over-year meant that increasingly more severe unlawful behavior had to be ignored.  Over time even the most severe of unlawful conduct was being filtered by responding police.\n\n&gt;12.  We found out about it, when six cops blew the whistle on severe criminal conduct they were being instructed to hide.  The sheriff and police Chiefs were telling street cops and school cops to ignore ever worsening criminal conduct.\n\n&gt;13. The police were in a bind.  They were encountering evidence of criminal conduct and yet they had to hide the conduct. There were examples of burglary and robbery where the police had to hide the recovered evidence in order to let the kids get away without reports.\n\n&gt;14.  The police would take the stolen merchandise and intentionally falsify police records to record stolen merchandise *as if* they just found it on the side of the road.\n\n&gt;15. They put drugs and stolen merchandise in bags, and sent it to storage rooms in the police department.  Never assigning the recovery to criminal conduct.  Stolen merchandise was just sitting in storage rooms gathering dust.\n\n&gt;16.  They couldn't get the stuff back to the victim because that would mean the police would have to explain how they took custody of it.  So they just hid it.  To prove this was happening one of the officers told me where to look, and who the victim was.\n\n&gt;17.  At first I didn't believe them.  However, after getting information from detectives, cross referencing police reports, and looking at the \"found merchandise\", I realized they were telling the truth.\n\n&gt;18.  A massive internal investigation took place and the results were buried.  Participating in the cover-up were people in the media who were connected to the entire political apparatus.\n\n&gt;19.  The sheriff and police chief could always deny the violent acts (assaults, rapes, beatings etc.) were being ignored; that's why the good guys in the police dept gave the evidence of the stolen merchandise.  That physical evidence couldn't be ignored and proved the scheme.\n\n&gt;20.  From 2012 though 2018 it only got worse.  In Broward and Miami-Dade it is almost impossible for a student to get arrested.  The staff within the upper levels of LEO keep track of arrests and when a certain number is reached all else is excused.\n\nAnd it continues. Check it out.",

While I disagree with the idea of arming teachers I think that police policy needs to be updated to reflect the fact that often these shooters are not looking for a firefight and will often kill themselves or hunker down when engaged. \n\nIt is unfortunate that this police officer failed when the time came, he is only human after all, but I don't think I can ignore that he could have likely saved many lives if he had taken literally any action.

The army has no farms. The army has no factories. The army has no fuel refineries. Abroad, the US Army is a huge threat because they have a continent's worth of resources and manpower to just pour onto the situation. In the US mainland, every city they bomb is now not only hundreds of thousands of citizens they have to provide for, but also hundreds of millions of dollars per year in taxes they're not getting.\n\nAdditionally, in the logistical nightmare event of a homeland oppression situation, they cannot force me to go to work with a drone or tank.

So Good Guy #1 is dead, thanks to you. and Bad Guy is still shooting people somewhere on the other side of the dance floor. OUCH! What was that?!

The USSS literally would not allow anyone to even stand while Pence was in the room. He’s a high value target. There are a lot of people that would like to bring him bodily harm. The USSS says no guns, that means no guns. It’s the law, and these are law abiding gun owners we’re talking about - they obey the law.\n\nThis also isn’t a normal “gun-free” zone, either. Whereas most gun free zones are not controlled environments, this one will be packed with guards, metal detectors, etc. In such a controlled environment, making sure the USSS knows the identity of every carrier IS the safest situation for the Vice President.\n\nHowever, a “gun free zone” with no guards or metal detectors is extremely unsafe for the VP. The law-abiding would leave their guns at home and the VP would become a soft target. In that case, (no metal detectors, uncontrolled environment, no guards) it would actually be SAFER to allow LTC-carrying citizens to carry. The Vice President would be far safer with gun-toting NRA members around him than in a “gun-free” non-controlled environment.\n\nThere is nothing hypocritical about that at all.\n\nLastly, people keep saying \"again\" because of the rumor that the NRA banned guns at the convention in 2015.

It's a subject he can't talk about without getting really angry and his face turning red. \n\nI keep telling him that the one sure fire way to get the 2nd Amendment repealed is the GOP tactic of stonewalling any attempts at common sense gun laws and demonizing the people who want to make it harder for people who shouldn't iwn guns to get them. Sooner or later there will be enough people in charge that are tired of foghting about common sense gun laws that they will be able to repeal the 2nd Amendment. \n\nI like my guns and I'm extremely liberal. Something like 5% of Democrats think the 2A should be repealed and all privately owned guns siezed. That is not nearly enough to do that but tye rhetoric from the GOP and refusal to take any action means more and more people are willing to go that direction. \n\nIn the end the GOP and NRA will have nobody to blame but themselves when nobody is allowed to own a gun outside of law enforcement and the military. Making laws is an exercise in co-operation between two groups who want different things. When one side refuses to even come to the table for a discussion, then when the other side holds power they are less likely to work together because of their past treatment. ",

Totally bought into the nonsense about it. Then I grew up.

It's the single biggest obstacle to safety and living in a sane society like the rest of the world. I get why it's there, it's the self-destruct button of the Constitution, but the Civil War proved that we don't need it because a crisis big enough to destroy the Union will fracture the military, and rebel forces will benefit from the rebel military units.

To a radiologist, it appears as a linear, thin, gray bullet track through the organ. There may be bleeding and some bullet fragments.\n\n&gt; I was looking at a CT scan of one of the mass-shooting victims from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who had been brought to the trauma center during my call shift. The organ looked like an overripe melon smashed by a sledgehammer, and was bleeding extensively. How could a gunshot wound have caused this much damage?\n\n&gt; The reaction in the emergency room was the same. One of the trauma surgeons opened a young victim in the operating room, and found only shreds of the organ that had been hit by a bullet from an AR-15, a semiautomatic rifle that delivers a devastatingly lethal, high-velocity bullet to the victim. Nothing was left to repair—and utterly, devastatingly, nothing could be done to fix the problem. The injury was fatal.\n\n…\n\n&gt; I have seen a handful of AR-15 injuries in my career. Years ago I saw one from a man shot in the back by a SWAT team. The injury along the path of the bullet from an AR-15 is vastly different from a low-velocity handgun injury. The bullet from an AR-15 passes through the body like a cigarette boat traveling at maximum speed through a tiny canal. The tissue next to the bullet is elastic—moving away from the bullet like waves of water displaced by the boat—and then returns and settles back. This process is called cavitation; it leaves the displaced tissue damaged or killed. The high-velocity bullet causes a swath of tissue damage that extends several inches from its path. It does not have to actually hit an artery to damage it and cause catastrophic bleeding. Exit wounds can be the size of an orange.\n\n&gt; With an AR-15, the shooter does not have to be particularly accurate. The victim does not have to be unlucky. If a victim takes a direct hit to the liver from an AR-15, the damage is far graver than that of a simple handgun-shot injury. Handgun injuries to the liver are generally survivable unless the bullet hits the main blood supply to the liver. An AR-15 bullet wound to the middle of the liver would cause so much bleeding that the patient would likely never make it to the trauma center to receive our care.\n\n…\n\n&gt; As a doctor, I feel I have a duty to inform the public of what I have learned as I have observed these wounds and cared for these patients. It’s clear to me that AR-15 and other high-velocity weapons, especially when outfitted with a high-capacity magazine, have no place in a civilian’s gun cabinet.",

They have been in continuous meltdown ever since.\n\n&gt;Hypocrisy aside, it's a good indication of the political threat they perceive from the post-Parkland gun control movement. The long-term prospects for the extremist views of movement conservatives on gun regulation do not look good.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;[T]he best [Republicans] can offer is stuff like what former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum proffered over the weekend: learn CPR instead of \"looking to someone else to solve their problems.\"\n\n&gt;For one thing, it's deeply telling that in reality, a hypothetical elementary school combat medic trying to save their homeroom classmates from grapefruit-sized high-velocity rifle wounds would be most concerned with staunching bleeding, not CPR. Conservatives can't even get their transparently bad faith deflection arguments right.\n\n&gt;And that is why they are largely reduced to smearing and defaming a bunch of kids trying to participate in American democracy. It's the only political move they have left.\n\n&gt;But more importantly, by refusing to accept even slight compromise in the gun debate, conservatives have made their position extremely brittle. After Parkland, public opinion has shifted fast in favor of commonsense regulations like universal background checks, a national gun registry, and reversing the ban on government-funded gun violence research. Meanwhile, fanatical anti-Democrat partisanship from the NRA is purging out the last vestiges of pro-gun sentiment from that party. If and when Republicans lose their grip on national power, new gun control measures are liable to go much further than they would have if the NRA and Republicans had accepted a tactical retreat.\n\n&gt;It will serve them right.",

        "body": "Do you actually want the answer, or are you asking rhetorically?\n\nIf it's the former, it's honestly pretty simple.  Your conception of how military force works is mistaken.  For quick reference - I served two tours in Afghanistan in an infantry battalion in the sticks.  I have long-term experience being a member of a modern military trying to put down a determined insurgency fought by poorly-armed partisans.  I only mention that because I don't want you to think I'm talking out of my ass here, I did this professionally and have studied it pretty extensively both in the military and out.\n\nHere's where you're going wrong:\n\n* You imagine the military as being united during a civil war.\n\nThis is a major factor, and understandably, it's a mistake a lot of people make.  You're used to thinking of the military as a unified block representing the government's legitimized use of violence.  In the event of a civil war, however, the military would not remain united.  I cannot possibly emphasize enough how much the average infantryman would resist orders to even so much as confiscate arms from the civilian populace, much less forcibly occupy their cities.  You have to understand - the people who plan on fighting back in the event of tyranny are the people whose kids serve and who've served themselves.  The combat arms branches are overwhelmingly southern working-class who trust the government a hell of a lot less than you do. (Yes, that is bizarre and contradictory, given their profession.  The American infantryman is a complex animal, outside his love of strong drink and obscenity.)  Think about what happened in Syria: part of the military stayed loyal to the state, part actively joined the resistance, part deserted and went to guard their own homes, and part stayed in to work as saboteurs.  Thinking a civil war would be military vs. civilian is a false premise; it would not be.\n\n* You drastically overestimate the effects of a technological advantage.\n\nThis is usually the crux of the argument.  \"What can your AR-15 do against a drone?\"  Nothing, of course.  If the government wanted to smash every populated area in the US into dust, they could do it and it would be hard to stop them.  That, of course, would also lose *them* the war as another major power would immediately step in to our shattered shell of a country and set up shop.  You can't win wars by bombing, full stop.  In my second deployment we shot literally tens of thousands of artillery rounds and dropped thousands of **tons** of bombs, and this was in a rural area where we had complete command of the air and high ground.  We killed plenty of insurgents.  Unfortunately, killing insurgents is about eighth on the priority list of \"things we need to do to win a COIN war.\"  It's often *actively detrimental* because when you kill a guy who has eighteen fighting-age cousins, a few of them are going to join right up in his place.  We're never going to win there.  We can drop five times more bombs every day all day for the next ten years and not a thing will change.  Boots on the ground are mandatory for occupation.  \n\nCheck it out, man - we fought people who were armed with ancient Enfields and improvised explosives.  Your average gun-owner in the US is at least as well armed as any given Talib and many are much, much better (and well-trained on top of that.)  It is basically impossible to crush an insurgency by force unless you're all right with simply leveling the place.  If the government wants to *win* a civil war, it *can't* level the place by definition.\n\n* You're ignoring the advantages of the \"other side.\"\n\nThere are a hell of a lot more veterans than there are active military, and to reiterate, the majority of active military would desert at least and likely outright defect.  I am telling you from personal experience - a hundred million armed people are far more than enough to stop \"the might of the most powerful military in the world.\"  Far more.  The difficulty alone in convincing US troops to engage American civilians on American soil on behalf of the federal government...  Hoo boy, if you can figure that one out, congrats, you might become dictator some day.  So far, though, nobody has.",

The average boomer was living their Leave it to Beaver lifestyle all the way through that period. Also, most of the social change you saw in the 60s wasn't even the result of hippy protests. The Freedom Riders and Martin Luther King were adults of the Silent Generation.\n\nThe hippies were a minority.

Yablonsky estimated that there were 200,000 full-time hippies in the United States who were both conspicuously identifiable as hippies and had dropped out of mainstream society.  In addition, Yablonsky estimated that there were another 200,000 teenyboppers, part-time hippies, and \"weekend hippies\" who might go to high school, college, or a \"straight\" day job, but participated in hippie culture on an occasional basis.  That gives us an estimate of about 400,000 total hippies in 1968.\n\nSecond, check the voting records. The boomers were solid Republican from the first moment they had the chance to vote.

        "body": "I'm sure this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but if we want meaningful and effective gun legislation, we have to start by acknowledging that in some regards, the NRA members are right. In the hands of a responsible and well educated person in the realm of guns, a gun is not a danger to others (accidental shootings happen, and I will address those later).\n\nThe easiest way to fix the issue of gun violence in America would be to take away all the guns. If there are no guns, you can't shoot people, and by making them so scarce it becomes very hard for criminals to get their hands on them and commit crimes with them. But we shouldn't pass legislation because it's easy, we should pass legislation because it's effective and right and fair to all our citizens. Taking away all the guns is not fair to responsible gun owners. \n\nWe need legislation that still allows the right people to own guns, and stops the wrong people from gaining access to them. We also need legislation that helps stop people looking to commit suicide from gaining access to firearms to easily, because that costs us a lot of lives every year. \n\nWith that in mind, what kind of legislation could we implement to achieve these goals? \n\n* We could start by mandating that to purchase a firearm, you have to gain a license. To gain this license, you would have to pass a test, similar to a driving test, that requires you show knowledge of gun safety, gun handling and that you have a gun safe with enough storage space to house all your firearms. You would be required to keep a tally of all your firearms at your home and on your person when you are carrying the firearms so you can properly report it to law enforcement should a firearm be lost or stolen from you. Edit: Following another reditor's suggestion, in order to ensure ease of access to all people regardless of background, we can provide a program to facilitate transportation to the facilities where this testing would be done. \n\n* You would also have to pass a psychological evaluation. A series of questions designed to establish your mental health, and a number of sessions with a therapist to ensure that you're not a danger to yourself and others. You would be required to attend sessions with a therapist on a regular basis (maybe once a year, but let's not get hung up on specifics) to ensure your continued good mental health. I also happen to believe this would be beneficial to society as a whole if more people saw a therapist, but that's another issue entirely. \n\n* In the spirit of the second amendment's well regulated militia, you would be required to attend on a regular basis (maybe every 6 months, maybe every year, but again let's not get hung up on specifics) a training camp with other gun owners in your local area. During that time, you would go over gun safety, gun handling and marksmanship with other like minded individuals. This would help create a sense of community and give people in that community a chance to evaluate other gun owners in the area, and perhaps surface concerns about the ability of a person to properly handle their guns, their character or their mental health. A little bit of self regulation might help avoid some disasters.\n\n* All of this would be financed by taxes on guns. \n\nOf course, there will still be accidents, and their will still be people that will slip through the cracks and commit horrible actions. That is an unfortunate side effect of allowing people to own guns, but people die in plenty of other leisure activities, and accidents happen every day. We cannot stop all of them from happening, but I believe with proper legislation we can still allow gun owners to own the guns they want, and protect most people from the kind of horrible acts we've seen.

But history shows that these are just used to deny the right. \n\n\"We could start by mandating that to purchase a firearm you have to gain a license.\"\n\nPlease read this and see how anti gun politicians go out of their way to try and prevent you from exercising your right. \n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/guns/2011/oct/5/miller-emily-gets-her-gun/  \n\nShe went through the hoops... You can see they just tried everything to make it difficult. And places like San Diego have made it so you can't exercise a right, unless you are politically connected.... Same with NY. In fact, I think there was just an arrest made in NY about a guy \"selling\" access to gun permits. \n\n\"You would also have to pass a psychological evaluation.\"\n\nWell, for starters... Good luck finding a mental health professional to sign off on this. One of my hobbies is skydiving. This has been brought up as part of a screening for students.... You know how many mental health professionals were willing to sign that a guy was OK to jump? All you need to do is ask pilots about the FAA medical process and get their opinion on it to know why this will not work. \n\nNext, you know that Cruz PASSED a mental health screen... Right?  \nYou know that the Pulse shooter was investigated and passed... Right? You know that the Fort Lauderdale Airport shooter tried to turn himself in... Right? The Isla Vista shooter was in therapy and the police were sent ot check him out, he passed. The Fort Hood shooter was KNOWN to have issues with his co-workers (who were all mental health professionals). I could go on and on and on. \n\n\"In the spirit of the second amendment's well regulated militia, you would be required to attend on a regular basis\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that it is an individual right unconnected to service in a militia (Heller, 2008). The militia cause gave *A* reason, not *the* reason. For example, they didn't mention hunting because that was as common as going to grocery stores today. It didn't need to be mentioned as a reason. The militia was controversial (still is) and that is why it was mentioned by name. And the Constitution (Bill of Right's actually) mentioned this in the 9th Amendment: \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\n\nSo just because hunting was not mentioned... Does not mean it is not protected.  \n\nWhat would actually save lives is looking at the actual situations. For example, why didn't the FBI act on Cruz? When the Fort Lauderdale shooter turned himself in, why didn't the FBI do anything? When the Pulse shooter was under FBI investigation, why did the FBI not find anything? Why did the Dark Knight shooter not get Baker acted?   \n\nOne very specific thing would be to put a temporary ban on ownership for people kicked out of school for behavioral problems.  \n\nOne thing I noticed, and that made me respond to you, is that you had ideas, but ALL of your solutions made innocent people who want to exercise a right jump through a bunch of hoops. I am not for rules that target and inconvenience 99% of the population when there are actually easy options that will target those who ave shown through their ACTIONS that they should lose a right. \n\nExample... Drunk driving is a problem. I would NOT suggest that every car in the US have interlock devices. That would be putting obstacles and costs onto innocent people who have done nothing wrong. I AM fine with crushing people who get DUI's. This is what lowered DUI deaths in the 80's.   \n\nDon't get me wrong, interlock devices on ALL cars would save more lives... But is that something you would support? \n\nAnd the VAST majority 61% of \"gun deaths\" are suicides. Out of the 34000 number thrown around, about 21000 are suicides. I don't blame the rope when someone hangs themselves, I also don't blame a firearm.  \n\nSo that leaves 10-12K deaths. The majority of those are related to crime. And we have a VERY long history of not punishing criminals who use guns. \n\nGoogle \"Byron Champ\". He is a felon that was caught with a gun... Know what sentence he was given? About 8 months of boot camp... Not prison, boot camp. When he got out of boot camp, he was later involved in a gang shooting in a park. But please, don't take my word for it, look it up for yourself.   \n\nYou want to actually stop gun deaths?\n\n1. Gun education in schools. Why is it that to prevent DUI's, pregnancy, STD's, drug use..Etc, we claim education is the key, but on guns it is not?  \n\n2. Arrest and actually punish criminals who use guns. If you are a violent felon and caught with a firearm... Why would you ever be let out of prison again? You have shown to have zero interest in rehabilitation.  \n\n3. When we KNOW a guy has mental issues... Put them in care. The vast majority of mass shooters had KNOWN mental issues. They all expressed violent tendencies, many were kicked out of schools, etc. Why were they not taken seriously.  \n\nNow, when you do all that, I will gladly look at other options if they don't work. But why should I agree to jump through a bunch of hoops (well intended) when we don't do anything about criminals and those with mental issues?   \n\nIf I don't reply, well, it is because I get down voted so much here that I can only post once every 9 mins.... And I frankly am not going to try and reply once every 10 mins... too much time out of my life when I know all I am going to get is down voted more. \n\n",

Generally accurate fire is preferrable; you're more likely to shoot your target and less likely to hit bystanders/family members/actually hit the target.  The NYPD has the same high-poundange set up on their pistols, which is why they have events like the 2013 Empire State Building shooting, where a guy shot a coworker on the street, the NYPD responded, fired 16 bullets, and hit 9 (!) bystanders.  There is no planet where inaccurate gunfire, especially from people who want to defend themselves or others\n\nIn school shooting type scenarios, accuracy at 100 meters doesn't matter when you are armed and unopposed.  That's why the Santa Fe shooting had 10 dead and 10 woudned with a simple shotgun and a .38 revolver.  An ACOG has slight magnification to it; that makes it less useful at closer ranges, but more useful at intermediate distances (such as for closer-range hunting).  Holographic sights, as evidenced by my latest weapons qualification, are also eaiser to aim accuratley at distance than iron sights.  Old timers liking to engage in pissing contests aside, I'd rather have people hit what they intend to hit at distance.  Any idiot can aim a rifle at the 20 foot target and hit it; they don't care about using fancy sights.  Has one even been used in a mass casualty event?\n\n&gt;there's a reason why old Marines brag about qualing with iron sights and ancient slabside m-16s\n\nBecause every old timer is convinced that kids these days are too soft, and back in my day, we had to fire our 1903's 15 times a minute accurate damnit!

Compare the ratio of rounds used to fatalities to the Pulse shooting. \n\n&gt;  improve handling under high rate of fire and in various positions (pistol grip), improve weapon maneuverability (verical forward grip)\n\nSo screw people with arthritis or any sort of impaired grip. Or that simply want to hold their gun comfortably. \n\nBecause that's what's making these shootings so deadly. People able to hold their guns. \n\n&gt;  aid in faster target sighting (ACOG, holographic, and powered sights and scopes)\n\nBecause it will be so much better in America if Americans can't hit what their aiming at. \n\n&gt; Also put a minimum draw length and draw poundage on triggers to make rapid semi-automatic fire less accurate by requiring a stronger \"jerk\" on the trigger. \n\nWhich will also make guns less accurate. \n\n&gt; That won't eliminate mass shootings, but could help make them less common and help reduce the casualty count by making less-trained shooters less effective.\n\nIt will make trained shooters ineffective. It will make less trained shooters a danger to everyone but who they're trying to stop in a self defense situation. \n\nYour proposal is not modest. It's preposterous. \n\n&gt;I suppose you could also mandate reloading systems that require more finesse to use, which would make them tougher to reload in stressful situations. \n\nSo not only can't we hold guns or aim them, we can't reload them. \n\n&gt;Also improve mental health services in the US, which are frankly atrocious.\n\nI agree. And the economy, the stigma surrounding seeking mental health care even if you don't have any mental illness, promoting education, and a few other things that address the reasons why people turn to violence to solve their issues rather than more reasonable measures. Also that don't try to hamstring people for having the audacity to defend themselves. \n\n&gt; With rights come responsibilities.\n\nYes. Which is about behavior. Not the quality of your accessories.",

They later danced the hustle in the 70's, and sucked up *all* of the money in the 80's and 90's. Fuck every last one of those clowns. But you real deal boomers? Thank you for everything you've done. And also for all the great music.",

The security guard had a pistol. None of them were able to do anything, despite that being their actual job. What makes them think a teacher who shoots on occasion for sport would have done anything different? And not only that, but eventually their rhetoric will go further. The next one of these schools that now HAS multiple security guards and now HAS multiple teachers carrying guns, and then a shooter comes in and kills people anyway, the NRA is just going to say \"Well maybe EVERY teacher should be trained and have a gun under their desk.\" At a certain point its illogical. Actually, it already is. Also, this is coming from someone who owns a shotgun and grew up with guns in the household.

A kid could work a job part time and afford to go to college without being $100,000 in debt that they could never pay back.  We funded the arts, invented Rock and Roll, and the world looked at us for moral leadership and for the most part we did ok.  Sure we fucked up in Vietnam and Korea. Republicans and Democrats agreed on basic facts-- they debated like intelligent statesman for the most part on how to proceed based on facts. We cured horrible diseases like Polio.  We went through the civil rights revolution, sure an ugly stain on our history but the people prevailed and we as a nation became better for it.

She's voted Republican in every presidential election of my lifetime except maybe 2008.  She voted for Trump, as did her parents and almost all of my relatives on her side of the family.  I grew up that suburban town and almost our entire extended family lives relatively close, with the exception of relatives in Florida.  My mother barely pays attention to politics outside of what's on the news.  I don't remember her saying anything about Newtown when it happened, or about any other mass shootings outside of \"man this is fucked up.\"\n\nDuring our last phone conversation, she brought up the Parkland shooting.  She sounded very distraught and talked about how ridiculous it is that this kid was able to get an AR-15.  Then she started talking about solutions and how the government needs to do *something* to prevent this from continuing to happen.  I've never heard her talk about politics in such an activist way, and especially not in a way that disagrees so much with Republican orthodoxy.  Hell, I'm Facebook friends with a lot of very Republican people from my hometown and many of them have the same attitude.  One Republican woman has a newborn baby and is basically begging for gun control because she doesn't want her kid to get shot at a school.\n\nThe fact that Parkland is a high school in a predominantly white, affluent area can't be overstated.  It's a major factor in why this particular mass shooting is having so much more of an impact on the gun control debate than previous mass shootings.  The GOP's failure to act on this shooting will continue the demise of its suburban popularity.  The GOP needs to wake up and realize that suburban voters are far more terrified of guns than rural voters.",

Period.\n\nRight now we have something akin to ~~three~~ a gun for every person alive in the US and that's completely unnecessary. That's not to mean that every single person has a weapon but that a small percentage of the population has more than one and is essentially hording weapons. Three-percent of the population own's around 133 million weapons.\n\nMy friend owns multiple guns and hardly ever hunts. He has more than one hand gun, a rifle and a shotgun in a gun safe. I may not be as close with him as I once was but I trust the shit out of him with a weapon only because I've known him for over a decade and served in the military with him. That being said I think it's absolutely ridiculous that he has so many weapons; he doesn't need that many and honestly he enjoys collecting guns. This is the mindset that is poisoning our country this thought of gun worship and gun collecting.\n\nThis isn't the only reason for the over-saturation of weapons however but another reason would be the ease of access to purchasing especially through sales in gun shows. There should be more restriction on purchasing weapons from a gun show as it's far to easy to get them now.\n\nAnother thing that should probably change is more access and use of mental health programs; everyone always just says \"We need better mental health\" but just saying that doesn't fix anything. My idea follows along with what the military does and goes like this:\n\n1. When you go and get your weapon permit you should have to undergo a mental health examination to show that you aren't showing red flags of mental instability.\n\n2. One should have to renew their permit once a year and part of the renewal process would be a checkup on the persons mental health even if they showed no flags in the original assessment.\n\n2. If one did show red flags during the original assessment they can still purchase weapons but under the condition that they undergo periodic therapy sessions over the course of a year and upon the next renewal of their permit if the flags are gone then they can stop taking the therapy. \n\n3. If one fails to pass a mental health examination they will not be permitted to carry a weapon and will be offered mental help before being able to undergo examination again.\n\nThe military does something similar to this but does not go near as in depth; they simply put out a survey of 100 or so questions to gauge how a soldiers mental health is but it's extremely easy to lie on those and nearly everyone does lie at one point or another on it.\n\nThis strategy wouldn't stop people from owning weapons unless they were deemed mentally unstable and even those people would be offered help and re-evaluation at a later date.\n\n____________\n\nEdit: Changed to a more recent (correct?) statistic",

You are also taught that your rifle is not a \"gun\" it is a weapon and its sole purpose is to kill the enemy. You go through extensive training to learn how to handle your weapon in the safest means possible and use it as efficiently and effectively as possible. You then turn your weapon in at the end of the day to the armory, unless you've been deployed to a combat zone where they rightfully should be wielded.\n\nAn 18 year old buying a rifle or shotgun at Bass Pro Shop on Saturday morning does not have the same training or discipline as a soldier. I will say that i agree with your other point on automatic weapon (although i still don't feel they need to exist in civilian hands).",

Rubio could have generated a very different reaction from the crowd, and could have been cheered, had he said and done the right things.  This was not a roast or a political smear - it *became* a disaster for Rubio when he let everyone know that his political voice and power were for sale.\n\n&gt; But I respect the guy for going out there and listening to these kids, and despite ungodly amounts of social pressure, still he stood up there and held his composure and answered their questions even if they were unpopular. And I appreciated him trying to explain why the issue is more complex than people make it.\n\nHim being answerable to his constituents is the bare minimum - he gets very little respect from me for doing one of the most basic things his job entails.  Admittedly, he's better than the cowards who didn't appear, but not by much.\n\n&gt; What is different between the ar15 and a Glock 19 or Walther p22 in the case of a school shooting?\n\nRate of fire, magazine capacity, bullet caliber, and ease of concealment.  All three factors would have impact on the killing spree in terms of number dead or injured, severity of injuries sustained, and the ease with which the gunman would be able to avoid detection or defend themselves from a counterattack.\n\n&gt; What would have been different? Nobody brought this up last night...not a student, not a parent, not Jake, and not the politicians. The sherrif wasn't booed despite dodging the home visit of 39 times question. He then tried to make the NRA lady act like she was making it up when it was in the news. The whole point of law enforcement and the FBI acting on information is to fill in the gaps when all other checkpoints fail in this process. The community , students, and teachers did everything right. The background check, the mental health check, and law enforcement failed in this.\n\nThe point the sheriff was trying to make - which the pro-gun talking head wouldn't let him say by constantly interrupting him - was that the laws are not adequate.  The NRA has actively lobbied to make it easier for people to acquire guns *and* make it harder to take guns away from people who have them even if they are a clear and present danger.  You're demanding law enforcement do things they lack the authority to do, but then when we suggest giving them that authority you and the NRA prevent those laws from being created.",

With the military, national guard and police what militia out there is necessary for the security of a free state? Do any exist? And wouldn’t it be a better use of time and energy to improve our public protection agencies rather than relying on arming untrained civilians?\n\nAnd follow up, if you think you need them to “revolt against a tyrannical government” like the framers did when founding this country... how do you envision uncoordinated armed civilians fighting against an extremely well funded and trained US military and National Guard with superior guns, planes, drones, jets, tanks, missiles and nukes?

If you use that definition then yes the NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nGenerally when it come to law enforcement they also add to that definition that the acts must be illegal.\n\nSo the NRA isn't going to be prosecuted as a terrorist organization but you probably could define them as one.\n\nNow on to gun owners. Very fucking few people would openly state that all gun owners are terrorists. I'm going to need you to back that up with more than \"I've heard\".\n\nWhat you are actually doing here is trying to derail the topic of discussion. Should guns be regulated.\n\nThe \"Technically correct\" or semantics argument is often used to steer the conversation away from the intended topic. Even if not purposeful your doing that here.\n\nSo let me bring it back on target.\n\nGun violence is a problem in America far worse than any of our peers. The supreme Court has more than once ruled that restrictions and regulations on gun sales do not violate the 2nd amendment. A sizable portion of Americans want some sort of control but politicians won't discuss it earnestly mostly because of heavy lobbying by the NRA.\n\nIt's time to do *something* and data from other countries shows that restrictions on gun ownership does work to at lease some extent.\n",

Yes, I have the right to drink alcohol, but we as a society have decided I need to wait until 21 to let people exercise that right. Yes, I have the right to own a vehicle and drive it; however, as a society, we have decided that I need to pass a set of driving tests before I get to hop behind the wheel.\n\nAt the end of the day, the rights we have as a nation were decided upon by people.

We will fight back against attempts to make it harder for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to revoke federal licenses from law breaking gun dealers, and ensure guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists, intimate partner abusers, other violent criminals, and those with severe mental health issues. There is insufficient research on effective gun prevention policies, which is why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must have the resources it needs to study gun violence as a public health issue.\n\n**there is 0 mention of repealing the second amendment.**",

Likewise, only 18% of those identified of **mostly liberal** favored that position. The most popular position among both groups was \"most should be able to own guns, within limits\". This position was favored by 65% of people who were consistently liberal and 49% of those who were mostly liberal. 14% and 31% people in these groups favored less control, respectively.\n\nAlthough there's been an increase in support for gun control since 2014, banning all guns remains a decidedly minority position. Procedurally, it would be basically impossible to repeal the 2nd Amendment in any event. Even if one could somehow get 2/3rds of the House and Senate, there's no way to get 3/4ths of the states.

        "body": "\"Unfortunately, incidents are virtually certain to recur so long as the first line of monitoring and compliance policing is performed by armed officers.\n\nIn short: we must disarm most police officers.\n\nThe Castile shooting occurred at a stop due to a broken tail light. Consider: the city of Chicago uses cameras to asynchronously ticket red light violators. Running a red light is objectively more dangerous than driving with a broken tail light, but Chicago will allow you to continue driving unimpeded after doing so.\n\nFurther, consider: any number of other violations in Chicago --- expired plates, bad stickers, poor selection of parking places, failure to pay parking fees, outstanding warrants on your car --- are performed by parking enforcement officers who are not armed. Chicago also routinely deployed traffic direction officers who are themselves not armed.\n\nThe police force we have today will not allow itself to be disarmed. The realistic medium-term answer to this problem is not to change the culture of existing police --- we should do that, but we should be pragmatic about how far that will get us. Instead, cities that want to reduce police violence should stop hiring assault officers, and begin programs to replace them with monitoring and compliance officers who will accept jobs with a description that includes doing the work unarmed. Smart cities should find ways to offload monitoring and compliance work from assault officers onto unarmed officers. Police forces can be disarmed through attrition.\n\nCities are incentivized to do this anyways: assault officer hires come packaged with intractable pension problems. New job descriptions don't.\n\nConsider also: \"armed\" and \"unarmed\" isn't binary. When approaching Philando Castile's car to inquire about the broken tail light, the officer was by default no more than 20-30 seconds away from being able to fire a bullet into Castile. Smarter public policy can increase that delay from 20 seconds to something far greater. For instance: general-purpose patrolling assault officers can be (are, in fact, today) issued rifles and shotguns stored in their trunk. Those officers can remain armed; just, not with handguns, and not wielded by default.\n\nModern assault officers are in a double bind. They're routinely required to work in high-crime neighborhoods, often minority-dominated, and thus subjected to constant cognitive strain: they're put into contact with far more minorities at work than at home, and those minorities are sampled from a cohort anomalously likely to include criminals. Further, assault officers are acculturated and in fact trained to believe (irrationally) that routine job activities, like making traffic stops, are among the most dangerous things that can be done in America. They're stuck in a vicious circle of cortisol spikes and negative reinforcement. It is not reasonable to expect them to safely handle continuously-available firearms.\n\nI suspect we'll discover that confrontations between unarmed officers and armed suspects are less dangerous than confrontations between armed officers and armed suspects. Most (not all) suspects who shoot at cops aren't doing it out of spite, but instead of out self-preservation. Regardless, I think we already know what would happen if we reconstituted police forces to be 20% assault and 80% compliance, down from 90% assault: far less police violence, far fewer shooting incidents, less expense, and a greater civic recognition of the real risks of policing.\n\nDisarm most police.\"\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12057079\n",

You might also have a female head of household and an adult child at university that still counts this house as their primary residency.  So there you have one household with three adults, but only one gun owner.\n\nThe next thing would be the Statista survey you've linked.  They've labeled the survey incorrectly.  It isn't 42% of households have a gun.  The original Pew survey said that 42% of people live in a household with a gun.  Gallup did a survey that verified the Pew numbers.  \n\nThe actual number of people that own a gun is hard to tell.  The government doesn't keep that sort of data and people have some reason to feel they should lie when asked.  However, professional survey companies are pretty good at figuring out what the real number roughly is from the potentially bad data they have.  Pew and Gallup both estimated the actual rate was between 29%-30%.  About 20% of the population owns more than one gun.  A little over half the guns in the country are owned by 3% of the population.\n\nSo less than half of all Americans live in a house with a gun in it.  A little less than a third of all Americans are gun owners themselves.  About 1/5th of the US population own multiple guns (though that is a majority of gun owners).

It seems like the older the Constitution becomes the more \"sacred\" it becomes, as though to change it is to somehow defile it.\n\nIf the writers of the Constitution recognized that a mechanism to amend it was wise, why is questioning whether an amendment should be considered (or one's meaning reassessed) \"totally unhinged\"?  Why should quoting a single phrase out of the Constitution be considered the end of the discussion, when clearly the writers anticipated and allowed for changes, and such changes necessitate discussion?",

I'm not a US citizen, so amend or don't amend your Constitution.

Jaime was a great student, but she lived to dance. That was her passion. This past weekend would have been Jaime’s first dance competition of the year. While that was going on, we were visiting the cemetery.\n\n&gt;Jaime loved to make people laugh. And while she did that, she also was really tough. She was part of the Best Buddies program—a non-profit organization dedicated to creating friendships for people with disabilities. She was more than happy to take on somebody who was bullying somebody else. She wasn’t a big kid, but she didn’t care. She also volunteered her time at a local organization called the Friendship Initiative—an organization that has programs for people with different disabilities.\n\n&gt;Her vocalness was heard from the second she was born. I’ve always told this joke about my two children: When my son was born, he didn’t really cry a whole lot. He was actually pretty chill the first few days. Jaime came out screaming and an hour later she was still screaming. I turned to my wife and said, This one isn’t like the other one. But that’s who Jaime was—she was always vocal and passionate.

        "body": "Foreigner here.\n\nI would guess that close to 100% of the rest of the world would clearly see that gun ownership is the problem here.\n\nIt is my belief that, at some point in the (perhaps distant) future, guns will just exist with hunters and target shooters - and with them under strict control. Why? Because the alternative is demonstrably corrosive in a developed country.\n\nThe issue is really how you move to a better place and take the majority of the population with you as you go. This needs to include a majority of current gun owners.\n\nLet’s look at some relatively non-contentious issues .....\n\n- No guns for any kind of criminal\n- No guns for any person with significant mental problems\n- A cooling off period between purchasing a gun and receiving it\n- No weakening of what should be Federally imposed restrictions by any State\n- The rules related to gun safety and storage need to be strengthened. They need to be matched with stiffer penalties for non compliance\n- There needs to be legislation that reduces ads that glorify or make popular gun ownership - just has been done with cigarettes \n\nThere are no doubt other soft options and it seems these could be worked on immediately when the current political madness ends. Law changes that were seen as reasonable would be widely acceptable.\n\nBut there are also the more entrenched opinions that need to be worked on slowly and thoughtfully. Minds need to be changed and that may require generations. Here are some thoughts at how things could be moved slowly forward for particular views.\n\nThe Second Amendment: \n\nWhere does this say anything about the type and number of weapons that can be owned? There needs to be some reasonable restriction on a) the type and b) the number that a NEW gun owner can have. These can be as unrestrictive as you like to start with. It is the concept that there can be control in these areas without removing reasonably judged second amendment rights. There is then the potential to slowly tighten these restrictions as and when the changes can be widely accepted.\n\nThey want to take away my guns: \n\nIt needs to be said clearly that this will not happen. Restrictions articulated above relate to new gun owners only. However it seems to be that it is reasonable that certain categories of guns need to be registered and again reasonable that the owner pays for that administration. $5 a year and some paperwork would deter some. The State offering to buy back guns at full commercial price would chip away also.\n\nI need to defend myself: \n\nI think because there are so many guns in existence in the US that this is a reasonable position for the foreseeable future. However there is a position for some sense here. \n\n\nAs things slowly tightened, the number of people showing messianic fervour for guns would slowly diminish I believe. I, and the rest of the world, see such people as total losers. That view needs to become more commonplace within the US. \n\nWith changes of social acceptability and tighter controls, the school (and other) shootings will diminish to levels seen in other developed countries. Unfortunately that change will be slow. Years of inaction (or worse) by the GOP have doomed thousands of children.\n\nThe one thing that shouldn’t be acceptable to reasonable people is the status quo.\n\n",

I think you should have to prove you have taken a firearms safety course before purchasing a firearm, where's the outrage when you need to take a hunters safety course to go bow-hunting, I don't see any *reasonable* problem with requiring one for ownership of a gun. Hell, make it an elective high school class! I always hear about the right trying to take money away from schools art  programs, why can't they pump some money into schools for a safety course? It seems like a no brainer to me (for the record I do see the risks of having a political organization teaching in public schools, I'm just spit balling here).\n\nThese are just a couple ideas, and they certainly are not original ideas either, but they deserve to be examined.  I don't know if any of these suggestions would have prevented yesterday's massacre, but I really do believe some of these ideas, if implemented responsibly, could reduce the number of firearms related fatalities in the US. Ranging from accidental to cold blooded murder.\n\nI really don't claim to have the answers, I am just some dude on the internet, but I think I've heard some good ideas (many still need to be worked out), I just don't think we should ignore ideas because they may be somewhat inconvenient.  The 2A is important to many Americans, myself included, I absolutely **DO NOT** want to see it go away, but something needs to change. \n\nOur forefathers laid the groundwork for what would become one of the greatest nations in world history (so far) and other nations have looked to our system to try to emulate it. Some of those countries have done a fantastic job of it, because they see the shortcomings in the system. Our constitution was written so it could be changed, the founders realized that would be a requirement for our lasting survival. We, as a nation need to realize that by not adapting our laws to an increasingly rapidly changing world we will (or already have) fall off our position as an example to the world, we will become a backwoods.\n\nI'll stop my ramble now.",

The kid did seem like he had \"forgotten his lines\", but he also had recently survived a mass shooting.  \n\nI feel bad for these kids for a number of reasons.  Primarily, they went through a lot.  I think we should listen to what they have to say.  I also think that they are too close to the issue to think clearly about it.  That doesn't mean that what they have to say isn't important.  Screaming at people that they don't agree with like children isn't helping their case any though.  \n\nI don't think they know what they are getting into.  As soon as you become politically active, you are signing up for your private life to be politicized.  I wouldn't rely on any adult other than their parents informing them of this, and in most cases I don't think a parent would know to inform their child that this is an issue.  \n\nI hope they can find peace somewhere along the way. Even though I disagree with their stance, I genuinely feel bad for them, not only because of what they went through, but also because I don't think they know what they are getting themselves into.",

I'd think it would pretty much have to be an outright ban, which has zero chance of happening. Also, it would have to be national, because it's trivial to cross state lines.
