I am registered to vote and I have already called my state congressmen (left a voicemail). Are there any groups or organizations that I could join with a focus on gun control? In my opinion we need: a ban on assault weapons, increased gun control, and metal detectors, armed guards, etc. at our schools.",

He exchanged fire with the shooters, but was unable to prevent further death.\n\nSecurity Theater won't help us, it's just putting underpaid and undertrained people in unnecessary danger, and worse, streamlining the classroom-to-prison pipeline by normalizing police state policies.  Better to shape a world where the idea putting armed guards in front of a school is called out for the sheer absurdity of it.",

Licensing agents will review each applicant, and individuals who are denied will be given a chance to appeal. **Applicants must participate in a firearm safety course, undergo “enhanced screening” with in-person interviews** and submit to reviews of their social media. Additionally, the NYS Division of Criminal **Justice Services will review permit holders’ records monthly** for criminal convictions, criminal indictments and protection orders.\n\n**Purchasing ammunition would also trigger a background check** by DCJS, and the bill further **restricts the types of body armor** that can be sold. Hochul will tear up a deal struck under her predecessor Andrew Cuomo that stalled the implementation of an ammo sales database.\n\nIt also **defines “sensitive locations”** — such as schools, polling places and certain public gathering areas — **where weapons are off-limits** for most permit holders. The law also designates “sensitive places” where **illegally possessing a firearm constitutes a class E felony**. Such locations include government buildings; any location providing health, behavioral health or chemical dependence care or services; any place of worship or religious observation; libraries; public playgrounds; public parks; zoos; the location of any state funded or licensed programs; educational institutions both in elementary and higher education; any vehicle used for public transportation; all public transit including airports and bus terminals; bars and restaurants; entertainment, gaming and sporting events and venues; polling places; any public sidewalk or public area restricted for a special event; and protests or rallies. The law also **prohibits firearms on private property, unless the property owner allows it**. Business owners can display a sign on their property to allow concealed carry weapons on the premises. If there is no sign, concealed carry permit owners should assume firearms are off-limits.\n\n**Several groups are exempt**, including current and retired law enforcement, peace officers, security guards who have a special armed registration card, and active-duty military. **The law also allows hunting** and hunting education, **with the proper licensing**.\n\nOnce Hochul signs it, **the law will go into effect on Sept. 1** and the DCJS will **implement a background check database and gun training courses by April**.\n\nYou can read more in [this NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/30/nyregion/handgun-concealed-carry-ny.html?smid=nytcore-ios-sharehttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/30/nyregion/handgun-concealed-carry-ny.html?referringSource=articleShare) and [this piece from Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/01/new-york-gun-bill-pass-00043760).",

That being said, I can understand why many here would support it; we'd have to agree to disagree, but I can respect the opinion.\n\nI understand some here are immediately going to go forth and give this push-back a thumbs-up, simply on the merit that it is gun control; but there's definitely an argument to be made that a lot brought forth here is discriminatory in nature.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling fairly addressed the arbitrary (at best, discriminatory at worst) permitting process present in NYC and a few other counties downstate. Before, if you wanted to get a permit in one of those areas you more or less had to be a certain type of person (white, wealthy, and/or politically connected). NY's response is clearly an effort to skirt the ruling, and maintain these discriminatory practices.\n\n* \"Good moral character.\" Sounds good, but I can almost guarantee it is going to be used as arbitrarily as the \"proper cause\" requirement that the ruling struck down.\n* Firearms training. Again good sentiment, if it actually ends up being accessible, financially and locationally.\n* The \"enhanced screening\", in-person interviews, and monthly records checks. Again the *idea* isn't bad\n\nReally the social media deal is the only thing that sounds sort of dodgy in a vacuum. The problem is the systems being implemented aren't in a vacuum; they're in New York State, which has a history of maliciously motivated firearms legislation (see the Sullivan Act)\n\nThe body armor ban? Total bunk, far easier to purchase out of state than firearms.\n\nAmmunition background checks? As stated the previous governor attempted to instate such a system, the NICS weren't willing/able to accommodate it, and it was deemed too expensive to fund in-state. Not sure if that will be the case this time, but as it stands it just serves to inconvenience anyone attempting to purchase ammo online (a lot of retailers to this day still have no idea that there is a memorandum of understanding in place, essentially rendering the ammo check law inactive - or they're just not interested in trying to keep up with our bloated legislation).\n\n\"Sensitive locations?\" Incredibly overreaching, to the point of functionally being a near-ban on carrying in many parts of the state. I'm not going to get into an argument about the carry of pistols overall, but this disproportionately effects people, such as the many who live in NYC and rely on public transport.\n\nAn inclusion of exemptions for current and *retired* law enforcement is the classic hallmark of this sort of legislation. Rules for thee, but not for me. The police are a powerful political force, and none proposing this legislation would dare upset them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's already a big buzz about a lot  this not sticking, and I'd speculate the forces behind this legislations are aware of that. Still, election season is abound, and brownie-points are to be had.\n\nThere *are* compelling arguments for gun control measures, but anything brought forth should make an effort of effecting people equally - be they rich or poor, minority or majority.",

    "selftext": "Warning, long post ahead.\n\nNow, unlike other arguments for gun control, I want to do something different. Instead of spouting off the same old argument, I want to target 1 Aspect that a lot of the Arguments don't seem to realize. Instead of just saying the statistics, I want to put those statistics in perspective.\n\nLook at these Wikipedia Pages:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_mass\\_shootings\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_school\\_shootings\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_mass\\_shootings\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States\\_in\\_2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2018)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_school\\_shootings\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States\\_(before\\_2000)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States_(before_2000))\n\nAnd, those against gun control, try telling me that these lives are worth less than your supposed \"right\" to own a gun. Try telling me that 33 Lives at Virginia Tech, 28 Lives at Sandy Hook Elementary, 12 Lives at the Aurora, Colorado Movie Theater, 50 Lives at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, 17 Lives at Majory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, 15 Lives at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, and all those other lives are worth less than the \"rights\" you so fervently protect. Try tell me that all of those who survived, but were injured in those vicious attacks and everyone who now has PTSD from experiencing their friends and family being gunned down in front of them, that their psyche, their minds are worth less than you being able to own a MILITARY GRADE firearm. Try telling me that all of the lives who were changed forever, the Wives turned into widows, the Children Turned into Orphans, the Husbands turned into Widowers, the friends lost in the blink of an eye, and the family members lost in the blink of an eye. Tell me that their lives that were so thoroughly crushed into dust were worth less than your firearm. And after you put that into perspective, how sure are you that your supposed right to own a firearm designed for military, not civilian, MILITARY USE is worth more than the lives of real HUMAN BEINGS. One victim might be your drinking buddy, your aunt, your grandmother, your child, your friend, your mother, your father, your brother, your sister, your best friend, your girlfriend, your boyfriend, your husband, your wife, etc. You might even become the victim. All because you protested against gun control. All these lives were for nought.\n\nI'm sorry, after trying in vain to use an Appeal to Logos, I thought using an Appeal to Ethos and an Appeal to Pathos might be more useful.\n\nAnd I know the counterarguments to this. \"Well if more people had guns, they might protect the others against the 'bad guy with a gun'\". Well, how does the gun store clerk know who would be the \"good guy\" and who would be the \"bad guy\" if they didn't have a background check, which people for gun control want? \"Well, make sure they don't have a criminal record.\" That's a background check. \"Well, what about the Second Amendment? That's the 'Right to Bear Arms' Amendment.\" Umm, have you even read the Second Amendment besides the 4 Words you say. This is the full Second Amendment:\n\n&gt; A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. \n\n\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State\"? That sounds like the Military. They are \"well regulated\" as there are generals and the Department of Defense Found in the Pentagon. \"Being necessary to the security of a free State\" sounds like the purpose of the Military. They keep our country safe from other countries trying to invade it. And anyways, at that time, we didn't even HAVE a military. We just had sporadically arranged militias because we didn't have a military to protect our country. So the Second Amendment itself is horrifically out of date and needs to be rewritten or at least repealed in some form. I mean, would you support the ending of the Drug War? That whole \"War on Drugs\" was secretly very racist. And look at this webpage:\n\n[https://coolidgelawfirmaz.com/5-weird-and-outdated-laws-in-the-us/](https://coolidgelawfirmaz.com/5-weird-and-outdated-laws-in-the-us/)\n\nThis lists off some hilariously outdated laws. Like, in Florida, if someone steals your horse, the punishment could be hanging. ~~In Connecticut, a pickle, by regulation, must bounce when dropped from a foot high.~~ (I discovered this to be a myth.)\n\nHere is another group of laws that are hilariously outdated:\n\n[https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/50041/50-weird-laws-still-books](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/50041/50-weird-laws-still-books)\n\nLike Number 12: Bingo games can't last more than five hours in North Carolina, Number 18: Dance halls can't be close to cemeteries in South Carolina and Number 19 says that South Carolina dance halls can't be opened on Sundays, Number 21: Utah doesn't have Happy Hour, and Number 27: Silly String has been banned in Southington, Connecticut since 1996. So many of these laws are absurd and severely outdated. Anyways, it wouldn't be the first time a Constitution Amendment has been repealed. The 18th Amendment, prohibition of alcoholic beverages, was repealed by the 21st Amendment. So the very outdated Second Amendment deserves to be repealed and updated for the modern world we now live in. It really became outdated when the Department of Defense was founded September 18, 1947. So it's even more outdated today. We no longer need the \"well regulated\" Militias that the Amendment says as now we have the Department of Defense. It's like comparing the 1973 2 Kilogram (4.4 Pounds for Americans) Monstrosity of a Cell Phone to the Modern Sleek Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. Sure they may do the same thing, but would you really want to carry around such a huge mobile phone when either a Smartphone or a Flip Phone could do the same thing but be small enough to fit into your pocket? For you people who support the horribly out-of-date Second Amendment, it's like comparing a flintlock pistol to a modern Desert Eagle or a Modern Walther or a modern Glock or a Modern 1911. Or like comparing the muskets used during the Revolutionary War to the modern Sniper Rifles. Or like comparing the Cannons used during that war to the modern M1A2 SEP. Can you see how out-of-date the Second Amendment is? A Vampire falling asleep during the period of the Revolutionary War waking up today might be shocked to witness how humanity has went from muskets, flintlocks, cannons, and other explosives to now when we have the ability to wipe an entire city off the face of this Earth with a single bomb and the ability to use a rifle to mow down large groups of people. How in the HE Double Hockey Sticks did the Founders of the United States of America expect for us today to have such powerful weaponry? They didn't have an oracle saying how powerful our weaponry would become to tailor the Second Amendment for the eventuality of weapons becoming so powerful. Thus, I don't consider the Second Amendment as defense for the owning of such powerful weapons of war.\n\nSorry this is so long. I just wanted to say what was on my mind.",

The uphold the second amendment not as a good thing in and of itself, but as a protection for the concept of the right to keep and bear arms, which is what really matters.\nIt’s also important to consider that there is a currently small but quickly growing portion of the left that support gun rights as well. You’re not just talking to republicans, your also talking to socialists, anarchists, communists, socdems, liberals, progressives, and everyone in between. These people will not be convinced by appeals to the same statistics over and over again.

The 2A was intended for a well-regulated militia that was trained, disciplined, backed and enforced by the government to put down internal rebellions, not to fight off government tyranny.\n\nThe NRA has successfully spread and planted falsehoods, and put pro-gun/NRA-tied politicians and lawmakers in power by opposing any kinds of gun control laws.

It plays right into the hands of the NRA, and it doesn't generate the much-needed grassroots gun control movements.\n\nWe need to grow a spine and push for the 2A repeal. Make repealing the 2A an Overton Window. Because of the 2A, the Supreme Court can strike down any gun control laws, saying it's unconstitutional. The New York permit laws is the most recent example. The 2A is a stumbling block to sensible gun control laws, so it needs to go.\n\nI highly recommend everyone read *Repeal the Second Amendment* by Allan J. Lichtman.

Where the vast majority of people who would otherwise be flagged by a background check due to felony convictions or otherwise, go to procure A weapon illegally - legally!￼ What Rational is behind the whole idea￼ of not requiring background checks to buy weapons￼ at a gun show or from private dealer, ￼when those situations are inherently ￼more sketchy!? Other than protecting the last accessible point of purchase for people whom are otherwise ineligible? As, that’s the only logic that follows!￼\n\nThere has to be something technologically impeding School shootings, and mass shootings as an epidemic, all together! Something that can stop it, instantly!￼￼\n\nThe status quo is￼ robbing our society of our greatest and most precious resource, children! It’s causing an environment, where I am listening to a 10yro little girl explain dipping her hands in blood, smudging it on her person and playing dead, for what felt  like three hours to her! And how she’s now afraid of men, in general! Because it’s men, usually under the age of 21! I think the oldest in a school shooting was 20, at Sandy Hook! ￼Listening to ￼Two little 11-year-old boys saying how afraid they now are of guns, and don’t ever want to go back to school! Can you imagine being 10 years old, and having the thought process available of that little girl? To know she needed to do everything possible to convincingly play dead?￼￼\n\nGuns should always invoke a certain amount of respect, but they shouldn’t be generically feared by children, bc that reaches Police, resource officers, ￼and in place like Texas, with constitutional carry… I don’t know the actual statistic, but a lot of people are carrying guns on their body, openly! They even go into a public place with a rifle in hand, under constitutional carry! Children deserve to be able to see police officers, sheriffs, deputies, or￼￼￼ ￼anybody else that doesn’t mean them harm, as a friend! ￼\n\n￼￼￼￼There has been 30 shootings on K -12 campuses, just this year! I remember￼ the morning of columbine! And the days after! It’s gotten to the point from where you no longer hear about 90% of them! Especially if they don’t have fatalities! I guess it’s not newsworthy to talk about it when it’s prevented! Which is a shame, right now, because obviously, the law-enforcement model for approaching and Neutralizing￼￼ An active shooter, is usually effective! ￼\n\nThis needs to be a public health and prevention conversation, not a political one! Which makes it even that more absolutely unreal and completely evil that the NRA is having a huge annual retreat today! Despite even some of the country music singers scheduled to play, backing out!  And a huge backlash from its own members saying, not the time certainly not the place! That is apathy at its highest￼! It’s the height of polititization in the middle of this, a couple hundred miles down the road of the second worst school shooting in history! Where they haven’t even started the services for the fallen children yet!￼\n\nRed flag laws, universal background checks uncapped by an arbitrary time limit￼, If it’s federal law that a person needs to be 21 to own a handgun, it is completely illogical that he or she wouldn’t need to be 21 to own an assault rifle!￼ Simple things like the 72 hour window can be 86ed, what￼ do people think? If the shop owner gets it back in five minutes, s/he’s going to sell it to the customer in five minutes! If it takes five days because of whatever reason, deal with it! The turnaround time ￼doesn’t change the person’s status, it doesn’t make a person who’s ineligible of acquiring and owning that firearm - eligible, by default, at least it shouldn’t! Should it!? \n\nEverything else in our society that Leads to danger or death￼ has been subject to ever evolving￼ Legislation￼ and modifications that make them safer! The second amendment is not an absolute right, just like the first amendment isn’t an absolute right!￼ A dangerous person, does not reserve the right to be more dangerous! Just like a person doesn’t have a constitutional right to scream fire in a crowded theater, Causing people to be trampled￼￼￼! ￼\n\nLaw-abiding citizens whom own or want to own a weapon, for whatever reason, should have absolutely no problem with jumping through a couple hoops to make it safer, because at this point whether it’s a school, nightclub, grocery market, beach, movie theater, mall,￼ this trend is exponentially progressing! And it will continue to! It shouldn’t have to touch one’s life personally, for him/her to see the logic in doing everything possible to prevent this from continuing on the trend line it is on! As long as it doesn’t directly affect their Second Amendment right!\n\nI hate the Phrase “gun control“ because that puts people on the defense!￼ I want to see more proactive laws to prevent And safeguard atrocities like this, from happening, On what ever statistical level, it can be￼! I know, we are not going to stop this from happening all together, but making a dent is a noble pursuit￼! \n\n￼If the shooter had to be 21, Uvalde would not have happened! He literally waited until his 18th Birthday,￼ He didn’t go and seek to buy a gun illegally! He actually waited until he could purchase one legally! ￼ He didn’t seek to buy them at 17 or 16 when he obviously was being bullied and unhinged!￼ He waited until he could walk into a store, unimpeded, and walk out, unnoticed!￼￼\n\nSince Columbine,￼￼￼ People with HIV whom had a life expectancy of just years, can now live a full￼ life! We have Gone from AOL CDs in the mail, and Dial up modem￼s, to ￼holding the devices we have in our hands, rn￼￼! We have electric cars, solar batteries and wind mills! The Biotech space developed 2 Covid vaccine using CRISPR w mRNA tech in a little over a year! We have gone from TVs that took two people to carry over 25 inches to 40 + inch TVs under 25 pounds! We have a telescope 1,000,000 miles out into space! Nobody can move these days without a tick tock timeline of them￼, due to ￼ doorbell cameras and one in every storefront window! ￼We have fighter jets that can land and takeoff vertically! Drones, that can do just about anything! ￼￼etc etc \n\nThere has been so much advancement technologically and culturally! ￼Please don’t tell me, that with all the other solutions we’ve come up with since Columbine, it’s OK that we haven’t solved school shootings!￼￼￼￼ It’s not due to the lack of solutions, it’s due to the lack of Will. ￼\n\nHopefully Mitch Mc’Connell, Senator Cornyn, Manchin, Graham (Who has shown support for closing the Charleston loophole and background checks in the past), Chuck Schumer, Senator￼￼￼ Murphy, etc Put in a good faith effort, as they say they’re going to! And by good faith, I mean for neither side to continue to make￼ the perfect the enemy of￼ progress! \n\nThe House has passed bills, they need to take a look at those two bills, see where they can agree! And then debate the rest later! If they can stop one school shooting or massacre of grandmas, grandpas, moms and dad‘s while they’re shopping, etc, compromising the perfect will have been worth it!￼",

That when someone purchases a lot of firearms and ammo, why can't that someone be on the radar of the local authorities? And what I mean by radar is that your social media accounts will be reviewed by the authorities, now, I'm not advocating for an assault style guns ban, that would be a violation of the 2nd amendment, so yes, you can buy as many guns as you like, but be prepared to be questioned by the local authorities if you do. Now, for me, the only people that would be against the local authorities snooping on them when they buy lots of guns and ammo, especially assault style ones, are those with something to hide, those with criminal records, if you are a law abiding citizen with no criminal record, then you'd welcome the authorities looking you up, because you have nothing to hide.\n\nThere's nothing in the 2nd amendment that says what I'm suggesting is a violation. Having and owning a gun is a big responsibility, in fact, you have God's power when you wield a gun, because God has the power to take someone's life, and you as a gun owner have that power too, and as Spider-Man says, \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" and I feel like most Americans take that power for granted.",

Banning AR type rifles (anything modeled after military automatic rifles, even if they're \"only\" semi auto).  Maybe even ban semi auto rifles altogether. Banning high cap magazines.  Raise the purchase age to 21. Red flag laws.\n\nLet's fully find NICS and pay large bounties to gun store owners who report attempted violations.\n\nLet's get creative, though.  Gun manufacturers and the NRA promote &amp; sell these baby killing weapons, specifically the designed-for-human-killing AR platform, because they get money.  Okay, let's go after their money.\n\nWe saw some success with the settlement based around the \"man card\" type advertising.  But it will take a lot of settlements to succeed that way.\n\nThere are a LOT of steps between a manufacturer wanting to create a gun to sell and getting it into the hands of a prospective baby killer.\n\nQuick aside: some might object to the \"baby killer\" language but let's be clear - they know some of their products will be used to murder babies.  They don't care.  They have done nothing to stop it.  So: \"baby killer.\"\n\nAnyway:\n\nLet's find every metal supplier in America and ask them, repeatedly, why they sell steel to companies that build and sell baby killing machines.  Light them up on Twitter.  Some might become uncomfortable and stop selling.    But right now their willing participation in the manufacturer of baby killing machines is ignored.  It's \"just business.\" It's capitalism.  It's how markets work.\n\nSame thing for every copper, nickel, plastic, whatever raw material supplier.  All of this can be done to ammunition manufacturers, too.\n\nThose baby killing machines get packaged in cardboard boxes.  Go after the paper companies that sell them boxes.  They have fancy graphics on them.  Go after the marketing companies and the printers.\n\nThose baby killing machines are shipped.  Go after the trucking companies and last mile delivery companies.  Go after the USPS if they're involved.\n\nNow the baby killing machines are in a store.  Let's find out which stores sold guns used to murder babies and other fellow Americans.  Let's post up outside with signs like, \"baby murderers love Bubba's Guns &amp; Ammo.\" Of course make sure there's constant streaming video in case someone violently disagrees with the truth.  Other stores shouldn't be let off the hook either.\n\nAsk customers going in &amp; out if they're going to buy a gun or ammo to kill babies like [the latest school shooting].  DON'T GET SQUEAMISH.  These same motherfuckers support people harassing pregnant women in crisis, these tiny brained/dicked men can handle getting the same treatment.\n\nNone of these will stop the sale of these baby killing machines, but every success will make them more expensive.  Every missed sale could be a stopped mass shooting.\n\nDo you have family or acquaintances who love guns or own the favorite rifle of baby killers?  Ask them if they like the gun that was used to kill babies.  What specifically do they like about it?  Ask them to tell you about the features that make it particularly good at killing babies.\n\nCivility about guns is dead.  It died for sure after Sandy Hook.  The Republicans pulled a Weekend At Bernie's with it for the past decade, but it's well and truly dead.  The people &amp; for profit corporations who support the continued manufacturer, sale, and civilian ownership of semi automatic rifles modeled on military weapons are evil people.  Full stop.  They support the baby killing at Newtown, at Uvalde, and at the next elementary school shooting that will inevitably happen while we fight like hell to take our local, regional, state, and federal governments back from their evil hands.\n\nBe creative.",

    "selftext": "The diverging efforts reflect the national checkerboard of state-by-state gun laws that align with the partisan tilt of each state, while Congress has not addressed gun violence with meaningful legislation since 1994 when a 10-year ban on assault weapons was included in the crime bill championed by now-President [Biden](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/us/politics/white-house-gun-control-executive-orders.html).\n\nSince the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut killed 20 first-grade students and six adults, 13 states, all controlled by Democrats, have enacted or expanded background checks for new gun purchases. Meanwhile, 14 states, all controlled by Republicans, have passed laws allowing their citizens to carry guns with no permit process at all, as the Iowa legislation would do.\n\nThe political divide on gun policy across the states is another example of the way national issues — including abortion rights and, in the post-Trump era, voting rights — are defining local politics.\n\nRepublicans, by and large, remain staunchly opposed to new gun regulations, arguing that the Second Amendment is sacrosanct and should not be infringed by virtually any legislation. And they contend that gun violence should be addressed through steps like more policing rather than restricting gun rights.\n\nThey also regularly seek to limit what restrictions are on the books and, in some cases, they aim to capitalize on mass shootings to boost their fund-raising. Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado responded to the Boulder shootings on Monday night with an appeal for $10 or $25 while touting her commitment to gun rights.\n\n“They want to defund our police. Then they want to take our guns,” [she wrote](https://twitter.com/davidgura/status/1374213628195446788). “What do we think comes next? We cannot lose this right.”\n\nColorado, which [has a history of mass shootings](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/us/colorado-mass-shootings.html?searchResultPosition=1), including the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, in 2013 enacted background checks and training requirements for gun purchases; the state also banned sales of magazines that hold more than 15 rounds.\n\nRhonda Fields, a state senator whose son was shot to death in 2005, [led the state’s gun control push](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/us/gun-control-laws-clear-initial-hurdle-in-colorado.html) eight years ago. Ms. Fields said in an interview Tuesday that while Colorado’s laws had reduced gun violence, the solution to mass shootings was larger than a patchwork of background checks and other regulations.\n\n[Across States, a Checkerboard of Gun Laws Reflects Partisan Tilt - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/us/politics/gun-regulations-boulder.html?searchResultPosition=11)",

    "selftext": "Of course, gun violence is not the only area of research where politics and science clash. Climate change is a contentious subject that proves evidence doesn’t eliminate controversy. In the case of climate change, research has yielded a scientific consensus that man-made global warming is a real threat. But that hasn’t stopped a political debate over the existence of climate change from raging on Capitol Hill. Still, the ability to cite that consensus helps frame the debate, making it possible for the media, and anyone else, to more easily discredit the arguments of politicians who deny the science. Data acts as a check on rhetoric that has become untethered from reality, and evidence informs the creation of effective policy to deal with the threat.\n\nIn contrast, a scarcity of statistics on gun violence allows the political debate over gun control to take place in a realm that is often largely separate from actual fact. A lack of research makes it difficult to know which laws and regulations would reduce injuries or deaths from firearms and under what circumstances they might do so. When it comes to talking about gun laws, politicians are, to some extent, operating in the dark. “It’s very concerning that there’s been an attack on science and the ability to carry that out,” said Fred Rivara, a professor at the University of Washington who [helped conduct](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199310073291506) a study on guns in the home in the early 1990s. “It’s resulted in a sort of stalemate in terms of being able to develop effective policy.”\n\nTo be clear, it’s not that there isn’t any research. Private foundations have stepped up to try and fill the void of federal gun-violence research. After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, President Obama called for the CDC to conduct research on the causes of gun violence and how to prevent it. But Congress was unmoved and [continued](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2015/01/14/why-the-cdc-still-isnt-researching-gun-violence-despite-the-ban-being-lifted-two-years-ago/) to withhold funding. Still, there are some signs that government agencies are daring to defy political pressure from lawmakers and the gun lobby. A year after Sandy Hook, for example, the National Institutes of Health [put out a call](http://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-calls-research-projects-examining-violence) for research on firearm violence in a direct response to the president’s plea.\n\nStudies that do exist point to some potential conclusions. Research suggests that comprehensive background checks help keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Experts say that additional studies are needed to confirm that finding, however. Research indicates that safe gun storage can help reduce shootings. And evidence [shows](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/12/us/gun-traffickers-smuggling-state-gun-laws.html) that firearms are often trafficked from states with fewer gun restrictions to states with tighter gun laws, which means that an uneven application of gun laws across the United States may fuel an illegal firearms market.\n\n[The Missing Data on Gun Violence - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/gun-control-laws-research/424956/)",

There is no significant functional difference between a mini-14 and an AR-15, yet one is an assault weapon and the other is a ranch rifle.
