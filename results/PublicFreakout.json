        "body": "I worked armed security for about a year in the late 90s.  Depending on where I was posted for the shift I made somewhere between $5-7.50 USD an hour.  Responsible for all licensing/training expenses and ammunition.  But I had to use the company issued S&amp;W revolver and one speed loader.  I made less if I got assigned to an \"unarmed\" assignment, which was often.   On multiple \"unarmed\" assignments (I had a baton, but was not supposed to carry a firearm) I'd have local PD officers asking me why the hell I wasn't carrying at those assignments because they wouldn't feel safe walking in those areas without a firearm and backup with them.  I was stationed alone for all of these assignments.  After multiple times of being told by the cops I should be packing, I did start carrying (concealed) on those assignments. The only positive was that I was carrying my own piece and had a couple of extra clips  just in case.\n\nI only had to draw my firearm once, and that was when a large gang fight broke out in the parking lot of the place I was on assignment at.   I didn't fire, didn't even point it anyone, just had it out and ready as I was keeping myself between the fight and the innocents that were caught up right next to it while I got them into a secured, safe location and waited for the police to arrive.  I got absolutely reamed by the boss because I had drawn my weapon out of precaution and to protect the customers at the location, most of which were kids/teens.  I wouldn't have drawn my weapon if the gang fight didn't blow up the way it did, there were multiple handguns involved and multiple shots fired.  That was the day I decided that working 60 hour weeks for maybe $300 bucks wasn't worth it, even as a \"temporary\" job while I finished college.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as training, I just had to go pass a firearms test at the local PD.  That was it.  No tactical training, no de-escalation training, nothing.  Just, can you shoot straight and hit the targets within an acceptable scoring range.  So, no, your typical security dude is probably not going to be playing rambo.  \n\nOne time, when I was coming in to relieve the guard on duty I arrived just in time (I was usually a little bit early as a courtesy) to see him start shit with a customer at a convenience store.  This was an unarmed assignment.  Dude was being a total dick and the customer hadn't done anything at  wrong, but he was black and it was late at night and the guard was a real piece of shit.  When he started harassing the customer for no reason and threatening him, I was thinking to myself \"this is not going to end well.\"  The customer was a pretty big dude but again, had done nothing wrong.  When the security guard whipped out his baton and started moving physically toward the customer (who had seen me arrive a few minutes earlier and try to calm the guard down and just let this dude buy his hotdog and smokes...the guard told me to mind my own business and it was still his shift...cool no problem homie), anyway, the customer looks over at me like \"are you gonna jump me from behind here if shit goes down?\" We made eye contact, I shrugged  and made it clear I wasn't on duty.  So when the guard gets ballsy and swings his baton at the dude, dude just blocked, ripped it out of his hands, and proceeded to the ever loving  fuck out of the guard.  I had the employee call 911 and I eventually broke it up, but you better believe I let that cunt take a few hits before I did.  I did not attempt to restrain the customer or anything once I got it broken up...got the guard's baton back from dude and told him he'd better get to stepping before the popo arrive because even with everything on camera, he's probably going to come out on the wrong side of shit here.  \n\nWrote my report and was brutally honest about it being all the guard's fault (also provided an honest account to the police when they arrived).  The prick ended up getting fired over it, but the bossu was mad at me for not having the guard's back and not lying to the police and in my report to make it look like the guard was doing his job.  This happened within a couple weeks before other instance above, so between the two, that was that.  I went in, handed in my shit, got my last check, and never talked to the prick of a boss again.",

Trump was literally a personalistic leader, it was always himself over country and party, he not only desecrated the Oval Office but he used to enrich himself and scratch the back of all his unscrupulous elite friends. Worst part is that trump was able to run wild and his behavior was justified because of the white nationalistic and populist rhetoric he used. The man literally preyed on people’s bigotry and ignorance , he’s no idiot he’s a manipulative conman who knows that his fear mongering and divisive rhetoric is the electorate fuel of modern Republican Party which has now basically become a party of demagogues.",

And while Trump lost, he got millions more votes than he did in 2016. \n\nI now believe all it takes is someone smarter than Trump. They'll gather a core group of true believers and a ton of not very well informed people will go along with it. People will object but most won't risk their lives or freedom. \n\n20% of the Capital insurrection crowd had military backgrounds. The Pentagon **refused** to send troops when they were requested, and **lied** when asked if Michael Flynn's brother was part of that decision, only later admitting it when pressed. \n\nMost military bases have Fox News on 24/7 in common areas, rather than the more balanced and accurate Armed Forces Network.\n\nAll it takes is a few more generals like Michael and Charles Flynn to have the military actively support a coup.",

Now, just five years later, and despite a pandemic that closed many campuses for nearly a year, the number has exploded, climbing past 338,000.\n\n&gt;Our database wouldn’t exist if not for a school shooting that almost no one remembers. More than a year before Parkland, a 14-year-old boy in rural South Carolina took a handgun from his father’s dresser and killed him with it. Then the teenager drove to Townville Elementary and opened fire on a playground scattered with first-graders. His gun jammed 12 seconds after he fired the first round, but by then, he had already shot a teacher and two students, including Jacob Hall, the smallest kid in his class. Jacob, who was 6, died three days later.\n\n&gt;The story quickly faded from the national news because only a single child died, but when I traveled to Townville, I heard not about one victim, but hundreds. \n\n&gt;Siena Kibilko, a first-grader who’d also been on the playground, began locking all the doors at her house and dropping to the ground when she heard loud noises. Jacob’s friend, Karson Robinson, was stricken with guilt, convinced that he should have saved Jacob’s life. For the following Valentine’s Day, Karson wrote a card in his memory: “I loved him but he diyd but he is stil a life in my hart.”\n\n&gt;The torment extended beyond the kids closest to Jacob. Children who had been inside the school — who didn’t see or hear anything — were long consumed with fear and anxiety.\n\n&gt;“Noises are different now,” Townville Principal Denise Fredericks told me six months after the shooting, recalling the panic that ensued when a balloon popped at a school dance. Fredericks banned balloons at the spring festival that year — and now, six years later, she won’t allow them this spring either. Her students haven’t forgotten what happened in those 12 seconds. Some of them still ask to talk to her about it. \"Our recovery,” she said, “it’s not a linear thing.”\n\n&gt;School shootings remain rare, even after 2018, a year of historic carnage on K-12 campuses. What’s not rare are lockdowns, which have become a hallmark of American education and a byproduct of this country’s inability to curb its gun violence epidemic. Lockdowns save lives during real attacks, but even when there is no gunman stalking the hallways, the procedures can inflict immense psychological damage on children convinced that they’re in danger. And the number of kids who have experienced these ordeals is extraordinary. \n\n&gt;My first trip there was revelatory because it made clear that the vast majority of Americans fundamentally misunderstood the scope of this problem.\n\n&gt;Each shooting becomes synonymous with its death toll, the lone figure most people remember. At Columbine High in Littleton, Colo., it was 13. At Marjory Stoneman Douglas: 17. At Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Tex.: 21. At Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.: 26.\n\n&gt;After reporting in Townville, I began trying to add up how many children Siena and Karson represented, poring through thousands of news stories to identify every shooting I could find dating back to the Columbine attack in April 1999. My colleague Steven, a database editor, soon joined the effort, expanding the areas we tracked and analyzed.\n\n&gt;For reasons that researchers are still trying to understand, gun violence soared during the pandemic, a trend that spilled onto K-12 campuses when many of them reopened in the spring of 2021. By nearly every meaningful measure, 2022 was the worst year of school shootings in history. Across 46 acts of violence during school hours, 34 students and adults died while more than 43,000 children were exposed to gunfire at the places they go to learn and grow.\n\n&gt;School shootings are rare. That is, statistically, true, in the sense that a child is highly unlikely to experience one. But it’s also an assertion that infuriates many people, and for good reason. Are school shootings in the United States “rare” compared with the number in, say, Canada or England or Germany or any other developed nation? No, they are not.\n\n&gt;Our database also excludes hundreds of incidents every year that don’t technically qualify but that still terrify and traumatize tens of thousands of children: shootings at after-school sporting events, for example, or gunshots fired just off campus. And almost no students can escape the reminders that someone could open fire in their classrooms at any moment. In a country where gun violence is now the leading cause of death for kids and teens, millions of children must walk through metal detectors or run through active-shooter drills meant to prepare them for the threat of mass murder. By one estimate, school systems employ as many as 20,000 resource officers nationwide in an effort to keep their buildings safe.\n\n&gt;Ten months after Parkland, on a Florida campus 200 miles north, Lake Brantley High declared a “code red” emergency over the intercom, indicating that the 2,700-student campus faced immediate danger. “Active Shooter reported at Brantley,” read a text sent to teachers. “Initiate a Code Red Lockdown.” Students wept, had asthma attacks, messaged parents goodbye — but the threat wasn’t real. It had been a drill, kept secret “so people will take it seriously,” a spokesman later argued, insisting it was “the only way to get their attention.” In October, during a drill at another school in Florida, a teacher was accused of locking a fifth-grader out of his classroom, forcing the boy to hide in a bathroom stall where he feared the shooter (who did not exist) would find and kill him. The same month, parents of grade-schoolers in Texas complained that mishandled drills had left their children wetting the bed and begging for special locks to keep “bad adults” out of their bedrooms.\n\n&gt;And then there’s the consequence of school shootings that could never be described as rare: actual lockdowns.\n\n&gt; More than 4.1 million students endured at least one lockdown in the 2017-2018 school year alone, according to a first-of-its-kind analysis by The Washington Post that included a review of 20,000 news stories and data from school districts in 31 of the country’s largest cities.\n\n&gt;The number of students affected eclipsed the populations of Maine, Rhode Island, Delaware and Vermont combined. But the total figure is likely much higher because many school districts — including in Detroit and Chicago — do not track them and hundreds never make the news, particularly when they happen at urban schools attended primarily by children of color.\n\n&gt;Still, on a typical day last school year, at least 16 campuses locked down, with nine related to gun violence or the threat of it. The Post’s final tally of lockdowns exceeded 6,200.\nThe sudden order to hunker down can overwhelm students, who have wept and soiled themselves, written farewell messages to family members and wills explaining what should be done with their bicycles and PlayStations. The terror can feel especially acute right after school shootings like the one in Parkland, Fla., when kids are inundated with details from massacres that have taken the lives of students just like them.\n\n&gt;In New York City earlier this year, rumors of a firearm on campus sparked panic at a Staten Island high school, where teens desperately texted and called their parents, begging for help, telling them, “I love you.”\n\n&gt;In Fremont, Neb., students sobbed as they hid for nearly two hours in a girls’ locker room with the lights turned off after a teenager was spotted with a gun. When armed officers barged in, they ordered the kids to put their hands up.\n\n&gt;In Pensacola, Fla., a sixth-grader messaged his grandmother, certain a shooter was in the building after social media threats triggered a lockdown. “Please check me out before I doe,” he wrote her, then corrected his misspelling: “die.”\n\n&gt;In one case, at a school in Charlotte, a 12-year-old boy was so overcome with dread that he wrote a will, scribbling his home address and his mom’s name at the top of the page.\n\n&gt;“I am sorry for anything I have done,” he wrote.\n\n&gt;“I am scared to death.”\n\n&gt;“I will miss you.”\n\n&gt;“I hope that you are going to be ok with me gone.”\n\n&gt;“This is a clear and pressing public health issue,” Steven Schlozman, a child psychiatrist and associate professor at Dartmouth College, told us at the time. “We have very good data that children in proximity to frightening circumstances, such as those that trigger school lockdowns, are at risk for lasting symptoms. These include everything from worsening academic and social progression to depression, anxiety, poor sleep, post-traumatic symptomatology and substance abuse.”\n\n&gt;LB, whom I’m referring to by his initials because his family spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, was standing near 6-year-old Jacob Hall when the teenager opened fire, fatally wounding his friend. LB, then a first-grader, had been a regular kid before that day, making decent grades, playing baseball and football, enjoying rides on the lawn mower with his great-grandfather, “Papa,” with whom he lived. Afterward, he was so overcome with anxiety that he began to soil himself, dropping 20 pounds. LB obsessed over the shooter, his great-grandmother said, and fantasized about killing him. One day, nearly three years after the shooting, he called himself a baby, and when she scolded him for that, he said he knew how different from other kids he’d become. He was about to turn 9, LB told her, and he was so scared all the time that he still had to sleep every night with his Papa. It’s because of that boy, and the hundreds of thousands of other children like him, that we’ll keep counting.",

I’m in my mid 40s and was raised around lots of hunters and avid gun owners. I don’t ever recall seeing the types of guns we see available now. We have shotguns and hunting rifles. Sprinkle in some basic handguns. Didn’t have extended mags or rapid fire.   We also didn’t have a culture where we made the second amendment our life/persona. The access to the guns wasn’t as easy either and there were safety classes available and sometimes required.  Open carry wasn’t a thing.

We have a door in the middle. He opened it. He came in and he crouched a little bit and he said, he said, 'It's time to die,'\" the boy recalled.\n\nAuthorities say the suspect barricaded himself inside a classroom and opened fire on the people inside, killing 19 children and two teachers before he was killed by law enforcement.\n\n\"When I heard the shooting through the door, I told my friend to hide under something so he won't find us,\" he said. “I was hiding hard. And I was telling my friend to not talk because he is going to hear us.”\n\nThe boy and four others hid under a table that had a tablecloth over it, which may have shielded them from the shooter's view and saved their lives. The boy shared heartbreaking details about what happened in that room. “When the cops came, the cop said: 'Yell if you need help!' And one of the persons in my class said 'help.' The guy overheard and he came in and shot her,\" the boy said. \"The cop barged into that classroom. The guy shot at the cop. And the cops started shooting.”\n\nHe said that once the shooting stopped, he came out from under the table. “I just opened the curtain. And I just put my hand out,” he said. \"I got out with my friend. I knew it was police. I saw the armor and the shield.”\n\nHe said his teachers, Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles, saved their lives.\n\n“They were nice teachers,\" he said. \"They went in front of my classmates to help. To save them.” The boy said that it made him feel better hugging his family and telling them about his feelings. He spoke with a counselor and said a highlight was seeing his friend who also survived.\n\n“I would like to say to every kid and parent to be safe,” he said. Authorities have identified the gunman as 18-year-old ******* *****, a high school dropout from Uvalde with reportedly no criminal history. However, authorities say they are investigating if he has a juvenile record. He reportedly had no mental health history.\n\nTwo law enforcement officials told CBS News that before the shooting, the gunman got into a fight with his grandmother over who would pay the phone bill. Officials stress that information is preliminary, and are not sure if that was the trigger for the deadly shooting. In an update Wednesday, Gov. Greg Abbott said that ***** posted on Facebook three posts in the half hour that led up to the shooting at the school.\n\n1.\t⁠\"I'm going to shoot my grandmother.\"\n2.\t⁠\"I shot my grandmother.\"\n3.\t⁠\"I'm going to shoot an elementary school.\" His grandmother was reportedly shot in the face, but survivedd.",

In a country of 120 million people, that was enough to have crossbow possession to be regulated. In 2021 the diet passed a bill that made crossbows regulated under the same act that controls possession of swords and firearms. \n\nSince March 2022, police are collecting crossbows across the country and now any person in possession is required a license among other regulatory measures.\n\nBefore the national bill was passed. When 4 people were killed by a crossbow in Hyogo prefecture in June 2020, it took the prefectural assembly only three months to introduce the nation’s first ever crossbow control bill in September 2020. \n\nWe didn’t have people protest. Because having 32 crimes involving crossbows, of which 13 of them were murder/murder attempts, during the span of 10 years and five months (2010/01-2020/06), in a country of 120 million, is more than enough for the people to agree that it warrants possession control. \n\nMeanwhile in the US, countless school shootings and mass shootings later. \n\nEveryone is crazy. Even the people advocating for gun control. This is the farthest thing from normalcy in a developed country but the urgency is lacking. This doesn’t happen in any other developed country. I don’t think Americans realize how insane all of this is.\n\nAll numbers taken from Nikkei and National Police Agency report on crossbow violence that led to the crossbow control bill being passed. Amongst the involved experts in the report were chairmen from the Japanese Bow-gun and the Crossbow association. \n\nhttps://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQODG16BEE0W0A211C2000000/\n\nPolice Agency report: https://www.npa.go.jp/bureau/safetylife/hoan/hokoku.pdf",

Every secure installation has at least one, “Smoking Door” to save time.  Smoking doors are very often the door farthest away from the main entrance, and it eliminates half of your break that you’d otherwise be getting scanned back into the building, sometimes having to show ID.  I’m not saying that’s what happened here, but if you don’t want to go in the front door, there’s usually a workaround. \n\nEither way, it doesn’t really matter - the problem here is how easy it is to get a firearm, not a door that was propped open.",

The amendment is named after its author Jay Dickey, a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Arkansas. The amendment was introduced after lobbying by the National Rifle Association in response to their perceived bias in a 1993 study by Arthur Kellermann that found that guns in the home were associated with an increased risk of homicide in the home, as well as other CDC funded studies and efforts. Mark L. Rosenberg, the former director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, has described this amendment as \"a shot fired across the bow\" at CDC researchers who wanted to research gun violence.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

The reasoning goes: an active shooter isn't there to try to get everyone, just to get as many people as possible. Classroom doors are typically 1 1/2 inch solid core if they aren't steel, and ripping a handle off doesn't guarantee entry (a lead pipe is not going to open the door to my classroom unless you've invented a groundbreaking strength serum). If an active shooter approaches a locked door to a room with all the lights off, he is more likely to move on because there are no obvious targets. Yes, a determined shooter could eventually gain access, but odds are he will spend a significant amount of time doing so with a chance of not finding anyone inside. Shooters are not typically determined; just looking for as many obvious targets as possible.\n\nAnd there's always fighting if they make it past the door.",

The shooter was using an \"AR-15 styled rifle\" based on what I'm reading from the news. An AR-15 is fucking loud, and depending on where the muzzle device redirects the sound, it can be worse depending on where you are. For higher caliber rifles, you can easily feel the shockwaves rattle your bones a few yards away. There is a reason hearing protection is normally used by real life gun owners, and doubling up earplugs with earmuffs isn't uncommon. \n\nSudden gun shots without hearing protection will cause acoustic shock. Without hearing protection, even handguns can cause acoustic shock on the first few shots. Acoustic  shock will immediately disorientate you with dizziness and nausea, cause permanent hearing loss, and ear pain. While I've never shot my AR-15 at a laptop before, in the picture at the end, the holes do seem to be a larger than holes from normal 5.56/.223 caliber bullets used by most AR-15s. Whenever I go to the shooting range, I double up my hearing protection, and I still get surprised and slightly frightened when someone shoots a high caliber rifle next to me. If I was in their situation, where there is zero hearing protection and a guy is out to kill, I would personally scream like a little bitch, too.",

He said no matter what your try to find an escape route. Do not just hide and wait for someone to come kill you. If your stuck and at a location where you can’t escape you find an item or some position to attack the shooter if it’s inevitable they will come across you. He said psychologically a lot of these guys don’t expect any amount of resistance. So even a little bit of resistance can go a long way.

Lockdown procedures are well known, but do differ based on country, state or province. \n\nThe most basic form is for teachers or students, those closest to the door at the time of lockdown announcement is to lock the door, and turn the lights off, and potentially pull down or close window blinds, and then have all students move to a corner of the room away from the door. (Out of view of any windows in or around the door) The main goal of lockdown procedures such as this is to make the potentially crazed or deranged gunman assume there is nobody, or nothing in the room for them to attack. \n\nLike another Redditor pointed out above, there are newer more in-depth strategies in place in some schools that involve exiting the classroom if possible, not involving the use of main exits or hallways, but rather through windows that are close enough to the ground or other forms of exit. There are also tools designed to stop doors from being opened, not matter how hard the gunman may try, say they shoot out the lock or peep window, preventing entry and easy targetting of what are a group of sitting ducks.\n\nThere are many new technologies that are being developed to help protect the students in schools to prevent casualties like in this case. These kids were clearly safely locked in the room and this kid, teen more appropriately, was simply documenting what was happening. \n\nHonestly don't see why you're throwing any sort of shade towards this guy for fearing for his life and documenting it.",

The MAGA bomber.\n\nBefore he sent out bombs to Trump's specifically named \"Enemy of the People\" the MAGA bomber was on Twitter sending death threats to other people demonized by corporate right wing media.\n\nWe've reach several recursive layers of incitement leading to terrorism thanks to Fox News, Tucker Carlson, Trump, the Mercer and DeVos family. All of them paid millions upon millions to propagandize and incite their base to this point.\n\nThe creation of terrorists and insurrections wasn't a mistake, it was by design. Now some of those radicalized elements have made it to power.\n\nI'm tired of writing about this, been doing it for years. We need the passive majority to see that 2020/2021's multiple campaigns to detain/execute the right's political enemies has already been codified into a system of indoctrination and mobilization stretching back more than a decade.\n\nThe people who made Majorie are the same people who made the MAGA bomber, the same people who elevated Trump from TV star to domestic terrorist. We need to address these people directly, by name.\n\nMercer family: Funded Cambridge Analytica which helped elect Trump, then funded Parler which was used to organize the insurrection attempt.\n\nDeVos: Helped fund militias via Michigan Freedom Fund. They 'protested' mask regulations, used the events to mobilize the insurrection attempt against my state govt.",
