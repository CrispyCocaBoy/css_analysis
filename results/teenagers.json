I just shrug it off and think that gun control is probably going to stay the same since its America. After watching the videos taken by students in the Parkland shooting I feel super anxious or nervous whenever I'm at school. Even though I graduate in 3 months that doesn't mean there isn't a chance that a school shooting will happen at my school or any of the schools you dudes go to. I hate that even after all of these terrible things happen people still deny the fact that guns played a part in any of it. And even if it were 100% mental health it doesn't explain why the government cut down spending on mental health. Hopefully I don't get called a libtard for this but I just want to go to school without fearing for my life. I'm just really frustrated and scared about this and needed to vent.\n\nTL;DR Scared of going to school because of shootings",

She told me about the Boston Marathon bombing and that we don't know if it's terrorists. She also told me about an explosion at an Ariana Grande concert and people killed or were killed. I also recall watching CNN when a report came on about Harvey Weinstein having been accused of sexual harassment (in 2017). I was also in a car when I heard on its radio about at least 20 people having been killed at a nightclub. I turned on a TV and saw news about a shooting at a high school in Florida.",

    "selftext": "It's constantly touted about that \"OH MY FUCKING GOD, IN 20XX, THERE WERE MORE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THAN DAYS\". The truth?\n\nThe claim is Bull. Shit. Those numbers are consistently inflated using accidental discharges, suicides, or unrelated incidents. A lot of these counts have more school shootings than school shooting fatalities. They aren't \"mass shootings\" in the sense of someone taking a gun into a public place and indiscriminately firing. They aren't mass shootings at all. More often than not, it's a drug deal gone wrong, a personal confrontation gone wrong, or a cop/security guard committing an ND. When the number of actual, *bona fide* school shootings is tallied up, it ends up hovering around 20 fatalities a year, at most. According to the census numbers, there are 76.4 million students in the US. That means that in any given year, a given student has about a 0.000026% chance of dying in a school shooting.\n\nThat, ladies and gentlemen, is a rounding error. A minor is more than a thousand times more likely to die in a car accident than a school shooting. This is why school shootings just aren't scary in any way to me. They're just such a non-possibility that there is no logical reason to fear them.\n\nBut there is a scary part to school shootings. The aftermath. How people react.\n\nI'm too young to have lived through 9/11, as is pretty much everyone else on the sub, but every 21st-century American knows the \"temporary\" and \"emergency\" powers the federal government took afterwards. 19 years later, many of those \"temporary\" measures are still in place, and everyone's just chill with it. This is what's going to happen with school shootings. There is nothing more permanent than a temporary measure. I recently learned that taking your shoes off at the airport was supposed to be temporary after the shoe bomber. Those \"temporary\" measures are still in place. The fog of fear &amp; panic overpowers everything else and prompts people to take drastic action without thinking. People are calling for metal detectors, cops, and ramping up security. People call for teachers to carry guns. I barely trust teachers to actually teach. I would never trust any of them with a firearm, especially at school. And there's no better example than gun control. I fall on the pro-gun side, but leaving my personal politics for a minute to focus on objective observation: It's no secret that school shootings are the centerpiece in the gun debate. But think about that for a minute. According to the CDC, in 2019, there were 39,779 firearm fatalities. As usual, about 2/3rds are suicides, a little less than a third were murders, and there were a few accidents. But, school shootings trump everything else in the gun debate. The \\~20 yearly fatalities come out to about 0.05% of gun deaths. Let me reiterate here:\n\n# Almost the entirety of the gun debate focuses on 0.05% of gun deaths.\n\nWe are debating legislation on something seen as a right in this country, based on 0.05% of gun deaths. And, beyond the legal &amp; political aspects, there's a cultural aspect. Somehow, schools shootings are so ingrained in the collective consciousness that they're the cornerstone of jokes and stereotypes. You never want to create a culture of fear, especially in schools. And on an individual level, the panic over school shootings is going to be detrimental to people who are lonely or quiet. Where they would have just become \"nerds\" in a bygone age, now they're going to be stigmatized as \"shooters in the making\". And the adults aren't setting a good example here. The example being set is to \"fear this, even though it's statistically never going to happen\", and it's going to train my generation into doing the exact same.\n\nI remember the panic after the Parkland shooting in 2018, but after looking at it a few months later, I realized exactly how ludicrous it was. 17 people were killed in Parkland. But looking at the numbers, the panic was unwarranted. If you look at MSD High, there were a little under 3,400 people enrolled the year after, and it probably isn't a leap to say there were more for the 2017-2018 year. This means that if you WENT TO THE SCHOOL WHERE THE SHOOTING HAPPENED, you had a little over a .5% chance of dying. But somehow, that prompted people all over the nation to panic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStop panicking. You will not die in a school shooting.",

I legitimately thought that there was some massive incident like some dude pulled out a gun or something. \nTurns out, the cops were chasing after some dude who was in a robbery or something.

A senior cadet in our class told us to head straight into our battalion storage room ASAP since the PA system said that this wasn’t a drill (or maybe it was; I’ve never been clear on it). Anyway, we were waiting in our storage room and SHTF when we heard the fire alarm went off (keep in mind that this was like I’d say a few weeks after the Parkland shooting). We were confused on whether to evacuate and run or stay but after about 10 minutes or so, we were given the all clear. \n\nTurns out, some kid brought a pistol to school. The school and the school district had to make s public announcement about the whole thing and it made my mom seriously consider moving us to a different school. \n\n- Earlier in the school year we no shit had literally 6 fights in one day. The biggest one was a massive food fight involving the entire cafeteria (this year so far, my school has had a shit ton of fights over stupid stuff). \n\n- During a Saturday 99 practice (basically just drill practice), I was doing Color Guard when we heard the fire alarm go off. Turns out, some cadets who were in charge of cooking probably burned something and it caught on fire. I’m not sure what actually happened, but at like 8 in the morning, a fire truck was rushing to our school. It wasn’t anything majorly serious, but we did get a cool moto photo with the fire truck. \n\n- Not exactly a true “wtf” incident, but a few weeks ago, our teachers had to give us a lesson on how to use the bathrooms.

While the threats made make it seem like a joke, it's still a serious problem. Since the Parkland shooting last year, this problem has been made apparent. I haven't been scared until today, until the third piece of grafitti was found threatening it tomorrow. We might be teens, and even if we can't control gun laws, or the actions of other people, we can still try and make a difference. While nothing has actually happened, I'm still pretty shook. Like in the title, we can figure out how for the next generation to get America in line with the other countries. We can do this. Thank you",

I have been there multiple times and I would of never expected something like this to of happen. I’m in a state of shock, disbelief, but also just de-sensitized at this point. If I went there today, that could of been me, but instead I’m sitting on the couch, very, very *very* grateful to be alive. At this point, I’m a bit blind to it, because even if it was so close, it’s just an everyday thing you hear about as an American. I’m still in shock because of how close it is.\n\nThere were people from my school who were there, and I saw a video of blood splattered on the floor, while two people were running away together. I saw a video of a SWAT team walking through the mall with their guns drawn, trying to find the shooter, while I can vividly remember all of the stores that are in those videos. Stores that I have walked by many times, both with friends and with family.\n\nThis is the second time there has been a big shooting in the area, being that Parkland in 2018 had a huge ripple in our community. I can vividly remember that day, and how half of the school either didn’t show up for the last days of school that week, and how everyone wore maroon for them the next day.\n\nI hope that no one has to go through such a traumatic thing in their life.",

    "selftext": "Today was Valentine’s Day, as many of us already know. So I was expecting an easy day at school except I got the exact opposite. My school had two shooter threats that were actually serious. Lucky both people were stopped and expelled for having weapons at school. They weren’t guns. One of them was arrest for a knife and the other is unknown. But whatever it was it was bad enough for the kid to be tased. \n\nUsually people make threats about shooting up our school fairly frequently. Those 2 people make it 3 or 4 this year, that I know of. But no one ever takes it seriously. However, my school finally decided to take these threats seriously since they were planning to commit their actions on the same day as the Parkland shooting last year. (We are in the same state as the parkland shooting as well.)\n\nIt was mostly scary for me because both people that made threats were classmates of mine. Many of my friends and I were talking about it. I think what’s even scarier is that none of us are afraid to die at school. We all know it could happen, especially today. One of my friends even said, “ I’m not scared. If it happens, it happens and I hope I’m alive when it’s over.”\n\nSorry to anyone that actually reads this for how “deep” and serious it was. But writing this really cleared my head. It’s crazy how serious this problem is in the US. Has anyone else had an experience like this at your school?",

These are people who, in many cases, watched their friends die. And these people have the fucking AUDACITY to claim that they are actors. Like how fucking DARE you claim such a thing. These are ACTUAL people. REAL deaths happened, and REAL people are talking about it. And the fact that people were talking about the killer for such a long ass time and only a few days later were the actual heroes mentioned. People like Peter Wang and the teachers who held the doors open and saved peoples lives and DIED doing so. It's all had me fucked up man. Honestly. I am just so sad about this. Then you have people who straight up neglect the fact that this all is connected to a MAJOR issue in our nation being mental health care being shit. Solving that problem would not only help stop school shooting but the MASSIVE suicide crisis. And NOBODY can come to a fucking consensus about ANYTHING because you ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY HAVE TO STAY WITHIN PARTY LINES. Fuck OFF if you think \"my way or no way\" and fuck OFF if you think that you cannot even DARE to put in a large waiting period to get your gun license and think that we SHOULDNT have larger background and mental testing for people looking to buy a gun.

    "selftext": "And thankfully it seems that common sense is winning. 2 members on my school board support it. One them when the Parkland shooting first happen called the students crisis actors. So he's a dumbass (who needs to resign). They had teachers do a survey about it and only 19% approved of training and arming teachers. Over 50% want more officers on campus, and about 30% wants stuff like metal detectors.  So that's a huge relief. At the meeting last night a whole 8 people came to voice their support for arming teachers. Only one of which was a student. I don't have a exact number of people who came out against it.  But it was too many to allow all them to speak. I can tell you that a few dozen kids from my school came to speak. And many kids from other schools came out to speak against arming teachers. The school board didn't vote on it yesterday. But this bodes well. One of the kids who spoke told the school board directly that any who votes to arm teachers. They will organized teenagers to come out and vote them out. Things are looking really good for people who aren't crazy.But hell i'm a senior so if they do arm teachers. It isn't my problem smh",
