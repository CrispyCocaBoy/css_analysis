Furthermore gun violence isn't all violence. There are enough defensive gun uses annually that the side effects of disarming innocent people need to be taken into account, unless you're for trading one tragedy for another.

I am quite willing to have a discussion, it's just not the kind you want because it has nothing to do with guns.I find it fascinating that the glaring and numerous failures of the FBI, the Sheriff's Department and the Parkland school itself are being completely set aside. Had the Sheriff's Department done it's job just once during the 30 some-odd times they were called to the shooters home and arrested him like, I don't know...the time he pointed a gun at his brothers head and threatened to kill him...he would have lost his guns. Had the FBI actually followed up on the tips called into them, the shooting could've been prevented. Had the school actually have pushed for his arrest and actually secured the buildings, the shooting wouldn't have happened. Had the school resource officer confronted the shooter instead of hiding, some people could've been saved....So instead of addressing the failures at almost every level of government and their failures to protect and keep people safe...some of whom it is their literal job to protect people...failures which prove the government can't be counted on to stop such an obvious threat...the left is demanding something be done about guns?

8aa3jl,,"Why toss in that youre a veteran? If true, thank you for your service. Still, how is it relevant to the national discussion? Does you being a veteran mean you get more of a say than someone who didnt serve?Nobody is getting run over at the polls on either side. Both groups are firmly entrenched and vote in bloc. That means the likeliest outcome is continued gridlock. If you want to have an actual conversation, you have to be open to equally-valid, opposite points-of-view. Ill beginYes, we have a violence problem in society. This is not necessarily unique to America, though. In terms of overall deaths, firearm homicides are curiously low when you consider how many there are in circulation. What I think we probably agree on is the disturbing use of violence by unhinged persons. Where I genuinely struggle to identify long-term solutions that specifically address this problem is in balancing the protections afforded for our Rights and freedoms with the possibility of serving society by legally barring unstable persons from not just firearms, but all types of violence that is at their disposal. In my mind, the conversation goes down the road of how do we address individuals prone to violence WHILE protecting the Rights of all Americans, including those we are concerned about because of their history of violence...Any solution that will address this concern needs to also respect the protection of Rights and liberties that we are all endowed with. So, while I agree that it can sound frustrating to hear that your proposed solutions are unacceptable to many in society because they do not adequately consider the aforementioned Rights and liberties, this is actually pretty typical of the idea-forming process. We all have to be willing to throw ideas at the wall without getting insulted when our ideas dont bear fruit because they failed to meet all the necessary criteria. The truth is that if there were an easy solution, we would have already found it. So, if youre willing, Im open to an actual conversation. But this has to be in the spirit of dialogue where we both take into consideration the other persons point-of-view.

8aa3jl,,"Ok, I can accept why you inserted the veteran comment. I agree about the Minority Report bit. Im not sure how we address it either. Where I disagree is in the only option comment. Frankly, we have many options. We, in fact, have so many options that we dont even know what all of them are at this point. In any conversation or discussion where we limit ourselves to only one option, we imply that our mind is made up and the discussion is over. Im hoping that isnt the case here. Perhaps Im reading tone into your parting comment, but it feels rather biting for the sort of conversation I was trying to engender. I offered my puzzlement to the problem and was curious about ideas for addressing violence. The idea you did offer doesnt work for meand presumably otherswho are not willing to budge on infringement of any of our Rights or liberties. Still, we should try and discuss the problem from the perspective of identifying a mutually-agreeable solution. Im wondering what sorts of mental health supports we could implement to address violence from the perspective of long-term solutions. My premise is that we didnt create violent individuals overnight, so its unlikely we will solve the problem in short order either. In terms of firearms legislation, as I read through your comments, it sounds like most of the ideas youve presented already exist in one form or another. As such, perhaps the breakdown in our communication is in the enforcement or oversight of those laws and statutes. Without going down the road of enacting new legislation per se, what are your thoughts about creating a better communicationenforcementoversight network to use the existing laws to both keep firearms from prohibited persons AND to respond to those individuals whoin one form or anotherwere clear red flags that should have been picked up along the way, a la Nick Cruz?In my mind, this is the first step that will provide us with the most return.

8aa3jl,,"We've both repealed amendments and altered them before.Yes, and we have explicit procedure for doing so. The Courts do not amend the Constitution, nor re-interpret it 'for modern times'. The fact that such belief is tolerated in our judiciary is itself a sign and essence of our collapse as a Constitutional Republic.First off, no we are not. That's why the nation is actively having a discussion about which weapons to allow ownership of and which to restrict. First, the nation isn't really having a discussion. A lot of authoritarians, unconcerned with actually understanding the issue themselves, are following the directions of their Authority figures mostly far-left University intelligentsia, and The State itself to march, backed by the overwhelming blast of absurd propaganda just look at this OP for a perfect example from the monolithic state-approved MSM.Second, the single most universal demand of these authority figures is far-reaching bans of all the most common firearms in the country today, which if done, will render the Second Amendment obviated. Recognizing this fact and what it might mean for the ability of any such laws to actually be put into effect, many are very openly calling for the formal repeal of the Second Amendment itself.Some weapons are already restricted, you do realize that correct? Bombs, chemical weapons, etc. We're just adding new weapons to that list for clear reasons.Yes, and these restrictions are legally structured not as straightforward prohibitions, but as prohibitively high taxes, which, later, they decided to stop accepting any payment of or, in some cases, straight-up 'emergency power' executive order martial law. All Federal Gun Control is structured this way by necessity, in order to pass them through the gaping loophole grant of absolute authority of the 16th Amendment personal income tax. They are still illegal on their face, because the Constitutional proscription outweighs the power. This is just the only way they have any slight whiff of legal plausibility a whiff for if you're physically or perceptionally blind.The amendment actually says ""A well regulated militia, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""You fucked up the actual letter of it and the interpretation. I'm not going to bother arguing this, because it was NEVER ACTUALLY A SINCERE ARGUMENT. The purpose of the 'militia' clause was specifically to contextualize the ""ARMS"" that it is ""THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR"" as weapons of war. Go read US V Miller, the first ever SCOTUS gun control case for the first ever national gun control law, circa 19381934 respectively.Also remember when this was written, arms meant musket and cannon fire. And rifles, pistols both rifles and unrifled, volley-guns, bombs 'torpedoes', blades and maces, and war-ships with many cannons which could destroy cities. And probably other things only remembered in history books. And all of these things, the state of the art weaponry of the time, were owned by private, non-state-agent Citizens at the time - which is precisely what the Second Amendment set out to protect.We've progressed in technology as a society and the founding fathers could not have forseen the weapons we create today when writing this law. No, this is either a disingenuous or extremely ignorant argument. Firearms such as are being discussed are fundamentally similar to arms of the time, and certainly nothing that couldn't have been imagined. This argument might have been a good thing to have, at the dawn of the 20th century, when we were watching the advent of aircraft and aerial bombing.

8h7qx7,Start Something,"Hello. My name is Jesse Young. I don't post much on Reddit but I had something I needed to share.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v7g11qzhp1MI live next to Parkland, FL. My wife teaches at an elementary school only a couple of blocks away from Stoneman Douglas. When the shooting happened both her and my daughter were on lockdown because the shooter was missing and within walking distance of their school.A lot of the MSD students are former students of my wife's school, including a few that died. This event has hit very close to home for everyone in this community. We all know people affected by it.Last month we were watching the March for Our Lives and I grabbed my guitar and this song came out. This isn't a political song. I don't know what the solution is to fix all this school violence, but I know something needs to change. I've been inspired by the students of MSD who have decided to take action into their own hands and make a difference. So this song is for them as my way of saying thank you and to keep fighting.I hope when my kids 7 2 go to Douglas, they won't have to worry the way kids do right now. And that parents won't worry like they do now. The problem will never go away but we can do better.This song is really for anyone who sees something that needs change. YOU CAN be the voice or the person to make it so. Stand up, fight for what you believe and never give up.Thank you to anyone who is trying to make a positive difference in people's lives. This world needs as much positivity as it can get.Thank you for taking the time to listen to this song. I hope you enjoy it.Jessehttpswww.youtube.comwatch?v7g11qzhp1M",7,jesseyoungmusic,2018-05-05T14:10:56Z,,0.17,0.16,0.26,0.18,0.12,0.11

Ask us Anything!","EDIT Thanks all for dropping in your questions. That's all the time we have for today's AMA, but we will be on the lookout for any big, lingering questions. Please continue to follow our coverage and support our journalism. We couldn't do this work without your support.PROOF httpsi.redd.it1f3wjeznm8ia1.jpgIn the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High massacre in 2018, we reported for the first time how many children had endured a shooting at a K-12 school since 1999, and the final tally was far higher than what we had expected more than 187,000.Now, just five years later, and despite a pandemic that closed many campuses for nearly a year, the number has exploded, climbing past 331,000.We know that because weve continued to maintain a unique database that tracks the total number of children exposed to gun violence at school, as well as other vital details, including the number of people killed and injured, the age, sex, race and gender of the shooters, the types and sources of their weapons, the demographic makeup of the schools, the presence of armed security guards, the random, targeted or accidental nature of the shootings.Steven is the database editor for the investigations unit at The Washington Post.

We still feel an obligation to tell people who the shooters are and what motivated the violence. Thats fundamental to the job. But were also very careful not to repeat the shooters names or publicize their images unnecessarily. And I think its made a real difference. Whereas most people could name the Columbine shooters, I doubt many could name the Uvalde or Oxford of Michigan State shooters.

The 10 worst assaults account for 57 percent of the entire death toll since 1999, and all but two of them were committed by white attackers, a reality that has left much of the public with the false impression that school shootings almost exclusively affect white students. Children of color, however, are far more likely to experience campus gun violence more than twice as much for Hispanic students and over three times as much for Black students. Shootings at those schools are typically targeted one student shooting one or two others. Fewer casualties almost always result in less media coverage. Based on all my years reporting on this subject, I also believe that shootings in black and brown neighborhoods tend to get less coverage, in general.

Bloomberg the former mayor and other billionaires throw tens of millions of dollars to fund gun control groups. His spending alone utterly dwarfs the NRAs spending, and he is on record stating if they start to catch up hell just dump more at it to outspend them. As a billionaire, he has the ability to do this, and at least hes putting his money where his mouth is.

I was stationed at Fort Hood in 2009. That one happened right across the parking lot from my companys building, and I had friends in there who barely escaped. There is a lot of raw emotion surrounding gun violence. But we cannot make progress on addressing root causes if we are constantly whipped into a hyperbolic frenzy about the gun itself. There are over 600 million guns in the US, and thats just the ones we can track. Pandoras box was opened and theres no going back from it. We need to find ways to work around it and live with them and move forward together, and those solutions do not include getting rid of all the guns. Thats an idealistic pipe dream. Maybe if we didnt hold guns up on this pedestal of being some super powered mythical instant win command respect or fear thing, it wouldnt be the first thing disturbed and deranged people turn to when they lash out. Maybe if we looked at why they felt disenfranchised in the first place and took the hard steps to assess and address those issues commonly poverty economic opportunity, no social safety net, etc we would make more progress. Roughly 6,000 veterans per year commit suicide, with half a little over 3,000 choosing a firearm. Roughly 500 people a year are killed with an assault weaponAR15-style rifle. So by simply addressing veteran issues youd do more to save lives than an assault weapon ban. Thats not a sexy fundraising issue though. Bloomberg isnt shelling out tens of millions and making big public statements about funding veteran support programs or job retraining though he has enough philanthropic efforts Im sure hes got some token thing going around that. Gonna cut myself off here because this is getting long but yeah. Its frustrating to see posts like this AMA that are designed to just rile people up enough to pass some other BS nonsensical gun control legislation that wont budge the needle on violent deaths and will be struck down in a few years anyway.",199,NorCalAthlete,2023-02-16T02:03:41Z,,0.14,0.17,0.20,0.14,0.17,0.17
1137rx6,,"Having to chop this into 2 parts as I hit Reddits comment limit, sorry -Posting this as a separate comment for further discussion I feel like many times we never get much further than shooting down each others arguments, so Im going to attempt to drive past that with some proposals of gun control measures I think actually might do some good.1. No more law enforcement exemptions. Equal footing across the board. Quit the class warfare. Of law enforcement gets full auto SBRs, so should the average person. Body armor? You betcha. Armored vehicles? Sure, why not. Either we all have access or nobody does. 2. Secure background checks available to all, instantly. It doesnt have to retain your info, but we live in a day and age where we can pull up medical and criminal records on our phones on the fly - I see no reason we cant have a system where NICS can be available to everyone, not just FFLs, so that even a private party transfer can have someone input their info and it simply spits out a green light red light yes theyre good to go or no theyre a prohibited person. Doesnt need to track whether or not they already own a gun, doesnt need to retain information that they just made a purchase, just at this time this person is good to go. THAT is a universal background check that I think everyone could get on board with, vs the current only-available-to-FFLs system. 3. Reimplement gun safety training in schools. If we can do sex ed, drugs, etc, under the guise of theyre going to encounter it sooner or later, they should be prepared to understand and know the consequences, I see no reason not to include basic firearm safety with this. They dont have to shoot live ammo or blanks or actually get any range time, but SHOULD understand how to safely check to see if a gun is loaded and unload it. They should understand to keep it pointed in a safe direction, keep their finger off the trigger at all times, and assume every gun they encounter is loaded until proven otherwise. Its not difficult. 4. Take suppressors off the NFA list. Its only courteous. Or at least allow threaded barrels and such so that they may be rented or freely available for use at practice ranges. Contrary to Hollywood belief suppressed gunshots are still LOUD and recognizable as gunshots. It just lessens the hearing damage and noise pollution from outdoor ranges. 5. If youre going to insist on licensing, then Im going to insist on tiered licensing and compromise speaking to the general you, here, not necessarily the person Im replying to. So for example at tier 1, you have to pass a basic safety test, and then can buy anything up to say, a 9mm semi-auto, a 20ga shotgun semi or otherwise, or .22 rifle any kind. Renew every 10 years. Tier 2 might be something like Tier 1 you can go up to a .44 mag pistol, .30-06 rifle, 12ga shotgun, plus mail order ammo to your house in bulk, etc. Renew every 5 years. Tier 3 is Tier 2 CCW, NFA items ie full auto, SBRs, suppressors, etc. Renew every 2 years.",20,NorCalAthlete,2023-02-16T08:24:22Z,,0.17,0.17,0.20,0.11,0.15,0.18
1137rx6,,"6. Waiting periods. 7 days so as to coincide with consistent days off work schedule weekend, only apply to your first gun the aforementioned NICS flag is easy to make where it simply is a Boolean truefalse for already a gun owner status, and exemptions for urgency such as a restraining order stalker, immediate threats, etc. It makes no sense that under current versions of so-called cooling off waiting periods I can literally walk into a gun store with a gun on my hip and still have to wait another 10 days for the next gun. 7. Quit the shenanigans with treating gun ranges the same way Texasred states do abortion clinics. Id rather have people who can aim and hit their target over people who spray and hit bystanders. Most homicides are targeted beef. Let it end with that and not catch 6 other people 100 yards away down the block if someone is pissed off enough to abuse it. Im not saying gun ranges should be as plentiful as Starbucks, but from a safe use perspective, you shouldnt have to drive 2 hours away to get some practice in, either. Not everyone has that option. No random requirements that seem reasonable but magically preclude a gun range from operating. 8. Mandatory sunset clauses. If new gun control laws cannot be proven to have had the measurable impact on gun safety they were purported to in order to pass, they get rolled back. Quit piling on when you know its not going to do anything. 9. Ease up on the plea bargains. Gun charges for people who have actually used them to commit crimes from murder to robbery are often the first thing dropped in sentencing. Fuck that. If youre going to pound the gun control drum for assault weapons and everything, dont then turn around and pardon httpswww.turnto23.comnewscrimebakersfield-family-asks-for-justice-after-gov-newsom-pardons-killer while he was already on the ground wounded from the first shot to his back. They shouldnt be bargaining chips. And Im not talking about oh he got a DUI and happened to have a gun in the car, by all means negotiate on dumb stuff like that where nobody was hurt. But if someone literally killed another person with a gun during a robbery or something...no plea bargain. None. Maaaaaaaybe if theyre giving up a bigger fish, but thats it. In a similar vein - lying on a background check form 4473 is currently punishable by up to 10 years in jail and a 250,000 fine. Out of hundreds of thousands who have failed their background check, fewer than a couple dozen have actually been charged for it. Thats some really, really low hanging fruit not being enforced. So the fact that we have people clamoring for more laws while ignoring criminals handing themselves to law enforcement on a silver platter just doesnt make sense to me. 10. Capping this list at 10 for now its long enough as it is. Ive probably managed to upset both some pro-gun people and anti-gun people with this list. Thats fine. Thats how you know its actually a compromise. So to finish the list taxes. Gun control has become well, maybe always was a class warfare issue. If youre wealthy enough, no matter what state you live in, you can get any type of firearm you want. Yes, even in California. And yes, even tanks! Gun control advocates have proposed severely increased taxes and fees on guns, ammunition, and gun parts, ignoring that theyve already been sharply increased several times in the past. If you think 20 is too much for a voter ID, and impedes the right to vote, then you should also be upset at things like a 200 tax stamp to get a suppressor for a firearm - its not even the actual firearm, just a part! When the NFA was passed, if adjusted for inflation it would be like being asked to pay 3500 for a gun part. That puts it squarely out of reach of most lower and even middle class people. Guns are an extension of the right to self defense and bodily autonomy, among other things. Guns are not solely for the wealthy, or for Hollywood. As long as they are manufactured to a certain minimum safety standard, ie dont go off randomly when dropped or something.",25,NorCalAthlete,2023-02-16T08:24:48Z,,0.16,0.16,0.17,0.16,0.18,0.17

1137rx6,,"Thanks for the latest. I dont know how much of the recent shift in proportions can be attributed to normal issues vs pandemic issues though. On average, over the last few decades, it has held relatively steady at rounding for numbers sake something like30k deaths, out of which 20k are suicides8k are gang related1k are police involved Leaving 1k unjustified including mass shootings and the like. The numbers HAVE spiked in the last few years. The pandemic has introduced new stressors, there have been more instances of police brutality sparking protests, under the cover of which bad actors have preyed on other innocents, leading to further loss of life. The economy has been all over the place, and loss of job is a pretty common factor in suicide. And yet. From your most recent figures the majority of gun violence deaths are STILL suicide. Homicides, even factoring in gang related and, by the way, the Guardian link on locality bears reposting still remain relatively low. 25k 330,000k. Can we do better? Absolutely. I simply disagree about how we might go about that, and believe that if we campaigned for, funded, and preached about things that would actually move the needle instead of just rah rah ban guns, we would have made more significant progress by now. Gun control, imo, is a losing cause, and always has been. I would wager that a significant enough chunk of single issue voters would vote Democrat, if not for gun control, that Democrats would win in an overwhelming landslide in any state or election that wasnt staunchly a Republican stronghold. And the way theyve been imploding lately, I would say even those areas might be winnable....if not for gun control. Gun owners are quite possibly THE most diverse voting demographic in the US.

1137rx6,,"Australia's gun violence was already on a decline before the ban though, and the ban itself only garnered something like a 10 compliance rate. So I don't think that's a particularly good example template to uphold, despite how often it gets brought up. Like, gun violence in general was already statistically insignificant there, and a single mass shooting was a blip. As for semi-auto handguns being overlooked in legislation - they're not overlooked, it's a very intentional part of a disinformation campaign on behalf of gun control groups. re rifles assault weapons that are typically the focus of new gun control lawsThe term ""assault weapon"" became widely used starting the late 1980s.

To address your other points, semi-auto handguns are actually typically MORE expensive than revolvers, and concealability is a wash - they're both easily concealable and roughly the same size depending on model and there are so many models of each it's a pointless generalization some revolvers are indeed too massive to conveniently conceal, and some semi-autos are the same. In the US, unfortunately we have several examples of mass shooters using non-semi-automatic clunky term for bolt action or single shot, but hammers the point home better I think guns. Primary among them being the Austin clock tower shooter. Additionally, I might point out that California's big thing for gun control is the so-called ""SAFE"" roster and microstamping laws, with the theory being a firing pin will leave a readily-identifiable mark on shell casings left at a crime scene that law enforcement can trace back to the gun owner. Ease of removing said markings aside, this microstamping is completely nullified by simply carrying a revolver, which doesn't automatically eject shell casings as you shoot. Lastly, to address the thought of ""nullifying the idea of carrying a firearm to feel safe"" - carrying a firearm is a whole separate issue from a semi-automatic ban. That being said, semi-automatics tend to be the weapon of choice, so perhaps there's at least more of a tenuous link between those than your other points.

There will always be guns in society, and by limiting the average citizens ability to defend themselves only more violence will be created.What I, as a high school senior, believe would be more effective measures in preventing gun violence, specifically in schools, is not more restrictions on every day citizens but rather better mental health screening and aid for troubled individuals, better cooperation between departments to make sure people who are not fit to posses firearms get flagged so they fail the background check to purchase them, and members of a schools staff who are deemed mentally capable to be armed. Police take, on average, 11 minutes to respond and have less knowledge of what is going on than those already at the scene.

For some reason, thats when we consider it to have all began its not, its just the first publicized occurrence.That was in 1999, halfway through the Assault Weapons Ban, which had the effect of limiting access to firearms like the AR-15. So, it is worth noting that the era of school shooting begins during the strictest period of firearms law in the United States.In 2004, the Assault Weapons Ban lapsed to much wailing and gnashing of teeth or applause and celebration depending on political leaning.Nothing happens.No, seriously. Nothing happens. The FBI collects and tracks crime data in the Uniform Crime Report. Over the years, you will see a trend beginning in the late 1980s of violence beginning to decrease that continues through until today. The AWB came and went, and there is nary a bump in the trend line to signal its existence. Violence, of any type, neither improved nor worsened relative to a slow decay experienced by almost the entire developed world.California, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, and several other states and individual cities enact legislation to control the type and use of firearms within their jurisdictions in response to the lapse of the Assault Weapons Bans or the ebb and flow of political tides.Nothing happens.In several states, Constitutional Carry passes, enabling citizens without criminal records to bear arms in public without individual licensure.Nothing happens.Concealed Carry Reciprocity passes, forming a network of states that each recognize each others license, allowing those with out-of-state licenses to bear arms in public.Nothing happens.Bump stocks and binary triggers appear, each purporting to increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic firearms.Nothing happens.An executive order is released to ban bump stocks under the assumption that they increase lethality.Nothing happens.The problems we have today absolutely were problems 20 or 30 years ago, and we havent been ignoring them, either. Weve simply been chasing ineffective solutions.Edit I should also mention that several major universities now allow their students to bear arms on campus, a change that was met with the sound of thundering crickets.",13,GreatBlueNarwhal,2019-02-14T20:09:32Z,,0.14,0.14,0.25,0.17,0.17,0.13

Most mass shootings are actually committed with handguns, and most handguns are semi-automatic, yet you dont really see that being talked about in bans. Machine guns or fully automatic firearms have long been banned and require intensive special licenses to own now. Politicians weaponize which guns looks most scary and while AR-15s have been used in some of the deadliest shootings we have had, even those have lots of different types. I dont say this to just illustrate how the left is stupid, just that if were going to enact effective legislation then maybe its time everyone who is so passionate about this do about 15 minutes of actual research and learn the differences so we can know what exactly needs to be banned.The vaccine example another commenter posted I think is a really good analogy.

I am sure some of the staff had opinions. I never felt unsafe in that school. I knew students that were there when the shooting happened and they weren't afraid for their safety. I also had a 2nd cousin that was a student at Columbine. I will point out a few things about a nation wide strike idea. In my state teachers are not allowed to be in a union therefore no job protection for walking out. Public School teachers are considered state employees and very few state employees in my state have the ability to form a union for collective bargaining. I think it is mostly Firefighters that can. Secondly all that is needed to defend the 2nd Amendment is 17 states. You need 34 to pass an amendment. I will point out I know of at least 13 states including Georgia will vote to keep the 2nd Amendment.Instead of talking gun control lets talk about dealing with the root causes of these shootings. In most cases including the one at my school the shooter was being bullied. We need more mental health counseling in the country period. We need smaller classroom sizes. We absolutely need smaller schools. My home county has 6 out of 12 non charter or private high schools that are 1500 students. When I was in high school we didn't have 9th grade on campus simply because the school building could not hold 3000 students. What people aren't talking about is the schools are too big that it is hard to police the root causes of these events. Finally we need to address school funding. This includes teacher pay.

1j9iw13,Teaching Outside Your Subject,"Not sure if I have the right flair. This morning, I was listening to the radio and was reminded of the day my music theory teacher in high school spent a day talking about gun violence. It was around the time of the parkland shooting in 2018. A lot of us were on edge and he could tell. One day that week, we talked about gun violence, how it affects our schoolscountry, and how we can stop it. It certainly wasnt the most in-depth discussion, and in hindsight, we didnt touch on nearly enough, but it showed me he cared about our concerns enough to address them and let us talk it out. It also hit the point home harder for me, hearing it come from my music teacher of all people. If even hes talking about it, this must be important, right?How do you feel about taking a break from your normal subject for a day to educate your students on social issues that affect them? Personally, I feel this is worthwhile, even imperative. How else are we supposed to raise the next generation to make positive change in the world if we shelter them from difficult topics?",3,JGilly117,2025-03-12T12:28:16Z,,0.13,0.13,0.34,0.16,0.11,0.13
941cup,Why My Contract Wasn't Renewed,"This is long. I'm trying to be as concise as possible, but there's a lot that went on.TLDR Listen to people when they tell you to keep your head down and your mouth shut.So, to give a little bit of context for those outside the US. After the Parkland shooting where 17 students died, Parkland students planned a national protest for students to walk out of school at 10 a.m. If I remember correctly, they were also going to have moment of silence for 17 minutes, one minute for every student who died.When I became aware of the protests, I talked to my 8th graders about it. We discussed why it was happening, what it was about, and what to think about if they decided to participate. I gave students a chance to discuss if they agreed or disagreed with the protests and the reasons it was happening. Overall, it was a very civil discussion, and we moved on.As it became closer to the protests, our school sent out a series of emails. One was from some higher up, saying students shouldn't protest. Another said that only high schoolers were allowed to protest. The ACLU sector of my state even sent out letters to all of the Superintendents reminding them that students have the constitutional right to protest. All of this culminated in a meeting with our Principal the day of, during which the 8th grade teachers were told that it was our job to stand in front of the doors and prevent students from walking out.This is when I'd had enough.During the meeting I told my Principal, I'm sorry, but I can't do this. She said that's fine, I'll write you up for insubordination. I said I understand, and that's a conversation that we can have later, but I can't do this. She told me there would be no conversation, I would be written up. I told her okay.I spent a long time considering if I was really willing to do this. If it was a fight I really wanted to have. I called my husband and talked to him about it. We talked about if it was worth the risk of getting fired. I talked to another teacher who I knew was written up and discussed what it meant for my license or my career at the school.In the end I decided not to stand by the door. I could not, in good conscience, tell my students that I support their right to protest, and then participate in something that was getting in the way of them doing that. It was hypocritical and I would have no part in it. In addition to that, I was also 7 months pregnant and I did not want to put myself in a situation where I could potentially get hurt.The time came and went. I chose to stand in the cafeteria that was designated as a ""safe"" place for the students who left class to protest. I wanted to show them whatever support I could, and the day moved on.A few days later my Principal calls me into the office and we have our ""discussion."" The conversation can be summed up in her statement of ""If you can't do what you're told, I don't think this is the profession for you."" She seemed to take it as a personal offense to her that I wouldn't do what she asked. I tried my best to be respectful, to make it clear that it wasn't her I had a problem with, and that I understood she was doing what was asked of her by the superintendent, but none of that mattered.So, at the end of the school year, I go on my maternity leave. The last day of school for teachers was the 25th and I asked my principal if I could come unofficially since I was still on leave just to say hello to everyone before summer break and introduce everyone to the baby. She says that's fine. I go. I talked to everyone. I talk to my principal, tell everyone that I hope they have a good summer and I'll see them next year.When I come home, I get a letter in the mail saying that my contract wasn't renewed.Some days, I still don't know if I made the right choice. I now have a daughter who has no insurance as of yesterday. I've been unable to find a new job. And we bought a house right before I got the letter. If I could have just done what I was told I wouldn't be in this situation, but I just hate that there's is so much backstabbing in some administrations.I understand that what I did was insubordination. I understand that there are consequences, but I also feel like the least my principal could have done was tell me that my contract wasn't going to be renewed to give me the chance of finding a new job. There was no need to wait until the very last day of school, and there was no reason she couldn't tell me to my face. And knowing that she's a person who gossips and can't keep a secret, I'm also upset that no one who knew thought to trust me with the secret and tell me my job was gone.I see a lot of new teachers asking for advice, and a lot of people say to wait until you have tenure to speak up.

Also again with the hindsight you should find out what the Union can and will do for you, rather than assume. Though I don't blame you for not wanting to fight all that hard, and risk having to go back to work for the same principal.Regarding your other comment, I think you should consider applying to your old school if you can get a feel for the current climate from old co-workersfriends, especially if the principal is gone.

u8oopt,Teachers of 2018 Parkland Reaction?,"If youre someone who lived on the planet of Earth during 2018, youve probably heard of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland Florida. If you were a student, teacher, or parent of a student in America during this time, youve probably felt that gut wrenching devastation and fear that came with watching something like that shooting go down. Parkland shook America. If you were a teacher during this time, the point of this post is to get your feelings on the matter, but specifically, how did you go aboutfeel about the student orchestrated protests held at schools, during school days and hours, all across America whether they were allowed by the school or not? Like for example, did you support these protests and uproars? Did you disapprove? And etc. I was in 7th grade when parkland happened and I havent been the same since. That very February, I ended up getting suspended along with two other students because we left our school with intentions to properly protest gun violence in schools. I remember there being a divide in opinions between the teachers at my school. Some of them were strictly unsupportive of these protests, some were supportive and understanding, some were in the middle. These reactions caused me to be curious about other teacherly stances outside of my community, so Im asking now! Thank you",1,astralluvr,2022-04-21T14:18:01Z,,0.05,0.32,0.21,0.26,0.09,0.08

8lobs9,"Had an ""realistic"" active shooter drill today... Oof","So I'm a first year teacher in a school that is considerably larger than the one I went to and security is taken very seriously. Especially after a recent scare in a neighboring district kids called 911 saying there was a shooter as a ""prank"" admins decided we should have a realistic shooter drill to see what problems there were with protocol and protecting students. The building was cleared of students before the drill started so that was at least one positive. We had no real warning, after have the gist of the drill being explained basically, you won't actually be shot and you'll know when it starts we were told to go about our day as usual. I went back to my room and waited. There was no announcement, just shots. I locked my door and went to where my students would be and just listened. The worst part was hearing the actors screaming ""he's killing me, help me"" and knowing that I couldn't do a damn thing because I had to protect the ""students"" in my room already. I had to let this girl die to save my students. It must be a special kind of hell for the teachers and students that survived parkland, Sandy Hook and all the other places that shootings have happened. I knew it was fake and that scream has still stuck with me. I just pray that it never happens for real.

He has always had behaviorauthority issues and is just kind of off.... in a creepy way. So yesterday he got in trouble and an argument with the teacher he has the period before me. He was clearly really mad so I just gave him space to cool off. During my class, I caught him off task on the laptops using a program we have that allows teachers to see students screens. When I started looking, I saw that he was looking up all of his teachers personal information including cell phone numbers, home addresses, and personal email accounts. He was making a PowerPoint, one slide dedicated to each teacher and all their information. This was really creepy to me especially because he was already so angry that I reported it to my admin. Whelp, found out today he was expelled from our school, that this was the last straw. I didnt realize me reporting that information would get him expelled, and now Im worried that he may come back for revenge. I teach at a school in Florida so the Parkland shooting is something always in our minds. The shooter from Parkland had just been expelled and then came back and did what he did...... what if this student does that? Would I be his target because I got him kicked out?? Would I be the reason this student came back and attacked innocent studentsteachers? I hate that this is the way teachers have to think now.

Why were the Freedom Summer murders? Why do we remember the things we remember. Note I'm not saying this is the same issue because I know someone will misread this if this post gets any traction. The American Civil Rights movement is just a really good example of this series of starts and stops that seemed to bubble over with change, when really the seeds had been heavily sewn for several decades of relatively little movement on the issues at hand and even plenty of regressions. I think that's where we are now with a lot of things, including this. Everything in history that changes anything becomes the tip of the iceberg. We don't see the whole thing usually unless you study it in depth, of course. We see the big moments. And those moments are picked by the collective psyche of mankind in some weird way, by fate sometimes, and they are the moments that generate change. I'm not sure Parkland will become the tip of the iceberg. It may be part of it, but it may take more to get to the truly defining and culminating moment. It's WAY too early to tell. But it feels different, you're right. Why? Because change doesn't happen over night. And it doesn't happen because some politician declares it. Change comes from the people.

8guu2v,need legalethical help about student threatening to shoot staff in the head.,"Need legalethicalmoral suggestions pls!Work at a self-contained school for students with severe EBD. My para and I are BOTH firm with rules, but some of the high schoolers really dislike my para basically have issues with women giving them directions. One student in particular had a rough year all around with everyone, but particularly her, and eventually ranted about putting a bullet in her brainthis was 3ish days after Parkland. The cops should have been called so much earlier, but that was the last straw, I talked to the SRO, got the ball rolling, student was arrested for terroristic threats, and spent two-ish weeks in jail before being bailed out. I know some staff thought my para and I were over-reacting, and some people were being jerks and passive aggressive about how they werent scared blah blah blah, but Ive stuck by my para and been supportive because no, being EBD doesnt mean you can scream about shooting people in the head with no consequences. Dude is 17.Anyways, kid made bail, is out, but no court date to determine anything, and he was actually eager to come back to school. Para not ok with that, says she will quit if he comes back and she is a fabulous para, I love her understandably, so I worked with ppl and plead our case, and student was put on home-ish bound, in theory to allow him to catch up and focus on his work without students asking him what went on, etc. but there is no court order that says he cant come to school.so then we came to end of course testing. Para was like wait, what, he has to come in to test? Yes, he does, do you want to take those days off, I will make sure there is no contact, but I can tell she is still upset and thinks it is unfair.Then today I found out that he is asking if he can participate in some end of the year activities, and he will most likely be coming back next year. Para is livid, saying she still has the ability to take out an order of protection against him and will quit if he comes back to school and will testify in court as to that effect. I dont know what to do. I want to be supportive and I want her as my para, but this kid has a right to an education, hes not incarcerated, he not inpatient, and if Dad really wants to make a fuss he could bring up the fact that we have students who HAVE physically hurt teachers, served time in RYDC, and came back to school. We have mentally ill students who HAVE actually brought weapons including guns to school, and after serving time, have returned to school. I honestly feel that if she pursues the personal protection order, she will be transferred to another school, because a right to FAPE trumps a right to employment and our contracts stipulate that we can be reassigned to another school at any time.What should I do? Do you think this student SHOULD be allowed back at school? I and FYI, kid has shown absolutely no remorse and is super pissy that we got him in trouble. I will be heartbroken if she leaves, but I cant keep fighting this.EDITED TO ADD one of the other big stressors is that the other teachers dont really think the situation was really that bad, and are irritated about all the extra work we have to do pulling together materials and lesson to be sent home, and the fact that we have to test him separately, etc.",3,Blueathena623,2018-05-03T23:34:23Z,,0.12,0.15,0.22,0.19,0.16,0.17

8bey95,USA Middle SchoolSS,"Warning Really, really long story but even shortened there is a lot to explain. I never thought I would be asking for help on something like this but I need advice on how to frame my time at my last school as I begin to job search again. I took a job this year at an urban middle school after two years go being a successful elementary school teacher. To put it bluntly, it was the worst mistake of my progressional life. Besides being out of my element with this new location, grade level and subject matter am certified, never taught, I shared a classroom with two different teachers for almost six months with no real divider as we waited to move into a new building, had no projector or smart board in a technology heavy 11 school, had no support for the fifth of my grade who spoke little to english or was pushed-in from the self-contained class as that was only for tested subjects and was teaching a grade level that had such a high amount of students with behavior issues that it required a meeting in which my principal asked the parents to talk to their kids because after over 800 write-ups in five months they didn't know what to do anymore.I struggled in a way I never struggled before. I did everything you could imagine to make my lessons the best they could be and manage the behaviors in my classroom. I worked a minimum of 70 hours a week. I also observed other teachers, asked for help often and tried every strategy I could but because of these issues that I now admit were out of control and also kept changing every time I felt I had a handle on things a new policy or school setup changed, my classes became more and more out of control.In response, I was a burnt out mess. I was having multiple nervous breakdowns a week, had a terrible stress-induced crohns's flare up that lasted over a month and would burst into tears multiple times a week not in front of students but co-workers and administrators which I think only happened twice before that and it was only to teachers I was friends with. I prayed that I would someone leave this job.I ended up getting my wish in the worst way possible.One day in class the students were working on a choice board project. This was one of rougher classes with a lot of challenging students including one who was determined to disrupt the class in whatever way he could. The student who I will called Zee would yell, run around my class, play on his computer with the sound all the way on and tell other students to stop working because my class was stupid and didn't matter. I did every possible consequence in my power but his behavior continued to worsen.I was helping a student with something when I overhead another student say the Zee was talking about bombings and how a muslim student in my class could help him. I didn't hear a lot but I did say I was going to follow up and write-up the behavior. I wrote up the fact that racist comments were made that next morning but what Zee said about bombings didn't really hit me until I hit send on my write-up. I barely heard how Zee was talking about bombing school but this was literally a few days after the Parkland shooting occurred. On one hand, Zee said crazy stuff all the time although nothing about weapons and bombs but it always was to just get a reaction. He was disruptive but ultimately he was a 12 year-old boy who wanted attention. But I kept thinking what if it was something this time. I would never forgive myself if I said nothing and I put my students' lives in danger. So when my supervisor popped his head in my class I asked to talk to him and explain what I thought I heard in class. I was expecting him to thank me and find the student to talk to him. We never talked about what happened in Parkland and how to respond to a situation like this. And teaching only elementary, this never was an issue before.Instead, he got very angry at me and asked why I didn't tell him this sooner. Taken aback I said how I told him as soon as I remembered and also with Zee he tended to say intense and disruptive things all the time and you had to take things with him with a grain of salt. But when I realized the next day the what what he said could mean, I got him right away.My supervisor tried to find Zee but he wasn't in school that day so a full investigation was done to see if the claims were real or not. Everyone was involved and they even his house was searched. Nothing was found, Zee was just talking crap to look cool and annoy the muslim student who he was fighting with that week.Despite it all being okay, my principal finds me during lunch and tells me that because of what happened I should talk to my union rep and see them after school. I am in shock and terrified because this is the last thing I expected to happen. I find of the reps and immediately begin crying My amazing rep, once she heard the whole story, first told me my work conditions were terrible and should have talked to her sooner. And in response to the incident, she assured me that I wouldn't get fired but would probably get a write up in my personnel file and reprimanded. The timing wasn't good but I didn't do it on purpose and I was as timely as I could possibly be considering I forgot about the main comment.One part was right. It was put in my personnel file. But I was told I made a gross misjudgment because I should have hit the red button and asked for a supervisor right away. But because of my classes being as chaotic as they were I didn't and put hundreds of lives in danger. Because of that I was fired but I had the option to resign in order to control my narrative. If allowed myself to be fired I would have to work 60 more days but if i resigned I would stop working as soon as I sent the letter. My rep was surprised and shocked at how that went but explained that treatment like this was not a new thing. I asked her what to do and she said I should resign. After the way I was treated I do not owe them any more work, and knowing me I could still get a job in childcare to support myself. So I resigned but surprisingly enough I left on really good terms with my principal and administration? They all wished me luck in finding a better matched school and my supervisor offered to write me a reference letter explaining the goods things they can say if they are asked and that I left the school on good terms.I got a job as a nanny and was planning on applying later in the year but found out there is a big teacher job fair coming up. There will be 29 districts including first district I ever worked at and this district is nice enough to not need job fairs to recruit so I'm super excited. I was loved at this district but it being a leave replacement it was only temporary and loved working there. I really want to impress them again and return and in normal circumstances, I probably would have. But here are my worries and the questions I need answers to.1. How the heck do I explain why I left? I'm not going to mention the incident unless they see my file and ask but my resume still says I left mid-year and I know how bad that looks. On one hand, I don't want to look like a complainer talking about how horrible my last school was. But on the other hand, I want people to understand that my situation was not typical. If I left, it was for a damn good reason so just because I didn't want to work to fix things. So if I am asked what happened, what do I say? Can I convey how terrible the school was without actually saying how terrible the school was?2. Do people actually check your personnel file? I was told it barely happens but it must happen sometimes. And it's going to say a little bit about the incident. So is there a way to explain that?Thank you in advance to all help!",3,throwawayacct201,2018-04-11T06:18:37Z,,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17

x0lisn,What Governor DeSantis Did Is Un-American and Undemocratic Four School Board Members Suspended Following Parkland Mass Shooting Report,,33850,alabasterheart,2022-08-29T10:42:25Z,,,,,,,
x0lisn,,"So I'm confused about so much more than what is said in this article. A grand jury was created to investigate the Parkland High School shooting. Okay fine. It's not inconceivable that someone would want to know whether there was a failure of administration that led to the shooting and whether someone could be charged. But it is notable that the decision to create the grand jury would have been made by a republican, and the school administration is mostly democratic.The grand jury apparently doesn't pursue any criminal charges, but releases a report on its findings. That's weird because that's not what grand juries do. In any case the report is confidential because all documents related to grand juries are confidential. This report finds that there was negligence and incompetence among School Board Administration in Broward county. But didn't recommend charges. Again very weird. This report was released in April of 2021. No actions were taken. But in August of 2022, 60 days before an election, the governor unseals a report and dismisses four members of the school board named as having been incompetent. Importantly he does this while a jury is actually deliberating on the fate of the shooter.He does nominally have the power to dismiss public officials who have committed a gross breach of Duty, but the timing is bizarre and just not referenced in the article. And now he can appoint four Replacements to an otherwise Democratic majority School board. Again, allowed under the law but very unusual.",4761,BigBennP,2022-08-29T11:28:58Z,,0.12,0.18,0.24,0.14,0.16,0.16

x0lisn,,"Basically the Constitution says each state must have at least one member in the House of Representatives and that if a state has more than one district, they must be of roughly equal population. Currently the House is also locked to 435 members which causes a lot of issues with properly representing how many members a large state gets and states get to draw their own districts. Each state does it differently with some having an independent commission doing it to lessen gerrymandering while others are made by the state legislature. There are also some rules that must be followed to make sure districts arent being drawn to exclude minorities. Like lets say one area is a majority African American and the population is big enough to warrant its own district, the lines cant be drawn in a way to break it up and split that population up into say four districts, because that would be discrimination. The biggest issue right now is the amount of gerrymandering and the fact that some legislatures have found out that there arent really consequences for drawing unconstitutional districts. The court system is supposed to send the map back if it has issues, but nothing is stopping the legislature from sending the same map back with some slight changes that dont address the issue. Eventually the election comes and a map has to be used, and guess what the only one available is.Edit 435 instead of 385 members in the House.",23,Rbespinosa13,2022-08-29T13:20:25Z,,0.17,0.14,0.23,0.15,0.16,0.16

Don't get me wrong Asshole cops are out there and so are criminal cops. But let's not forget that it is the job of our government, our elected officials, to create the kind of society that doesn't produce a mass murder every 4 or 5 months. Here are some things that would have helped this person out 1 free healthcare for his ADHD and depression. 2 A reasonable expectation at a satisfying life as a participating member of society, whether he is employed or not. 3 Free college education. Probably it would have reduced this young man's anxiety to know that if he didn't guess exactly right about what he should do with the rest of his life at age 17-18 that he wouldn't be paying interest on the loans he took out while he played out the process of working out his path in life. Maybe this kid would have still been as asshole. That is still better than being homicidal.

MLK and the others certainly led the movements, but they were equally as influenced by the every day participants.I guess my point in bringing this up is that leaders in these movements are important, but they're only as powerful as the people they're leading.These kids seem to be taking all the right steps to make change happen though, it's exciting to watch.

And finding space within that to convince people it's OK to ask for help is difficult.EDIT Just to be clear, this isn't a statement against better mental health access for Americans.

7xpqwo,,"True. However, studies show that it takes one or two generations for a fundamental cultural shift. Start out in schools with therapists directly working with kids - help the bullied kid to not internalize the abuse they're receiving so that it doesn't affect their self image help the bully work through whatever it is that is driving them to lash out at those around them. Work with the kid who is posting pictures of dead animals to their instagram. Not all kids will accept therapy since their parents will be against it, but once those kids who did accept the help that therapy can give grow up, we'll have a much larger portion of well balanced adults. People who didn't receive therapy when they were a child might look at how well-balanced their neighbor is, and wish that they had been more accepting of therapy earlier. We'll have a larger portion of adults who don't have a stigma around therapy, and they'll raise their children that way. Positive feedback loop.I'd also like to raise another point there are many people who claim that gun control doesn't work. Fine. So what is it that drives such a frightening number of people to lethal violence in our country that doesn't exist in other countries? What is different about our country compared to other western cultures like Canada or England? If it's not the access to firearms, then surely it must be that there is a sickness lurking at the heart of our society. We must do everything we can to cure this sickness, and I think both mental health care and education are the most powerful tools when can bring to bear against it.",10,KapitanWalnut,2018-02-15T15:14:07Z,,0.19,0.16,0.26,0.10,0.14,0.16

Either America has a disproportionate case of the crazies or theres an underlying issue. Much like heart disease or diabetes, every country on the planet has mental health issues, but they aren't having monthly mass shootings. Look I can side with the argument that more background checks and limiting firearm sales probably wouldn't stop the problem. Most of these shooters are using someone else's gun. I believe the solution lies with accountability. My guns are all in a safe that ONLY I know the combination to, all have a trigger lock, with keys that ONLY I have. If my wife or child or a friend wants to use one, that's fine, but I'll be with them and ensure they use it responsibly. If all gun owners all had this mentality, I guarantee there would be a significant drop in these shootings. First step is openly talking about the issue and then potentially implementing harsh criminal penalties to anyone whose firearm is used in any form of illegal activity. Most importanly allocate some money towards educating consumers on safely guarding their guns from even friends and family. Unfortunately Republicans don't even want to talk about it for fear of backlash from their constituents and donors, so instead we get thoughts and prayers and the clock is reset anxiously awaiting the next incident.If people guarded their firearms as well as they guard their atm pins, alot of this problem would correct itself.",8,mechapman38,2018-02-15T14:12:55Z,,0.13,0.10,0.19,0.15,0.23,0.20

If there is one force that is ruining this country more than any other, more than any president or organization or policy, it's FEAR. America is irrational fearful and paranoid of so much.Xenophobia. Racism. Sexism. Homophobia. They are all born from fear.Is this the kinda country we aspire to be? Land of the fearful, home of the afraid. Is that what makes America great? What does the NRA and their ilk use to promote their agenda? Fear. ""They're gonna take away your guns! They wanna leave you defenseless as a bad guy shoots up your kid's school!"" Fear is what they're selling, and fear is what America is buying.Or Fox News. Again, merchants of fear. ""The Deep State is destroying America from within! Liberal pizza rapists are letting Mexican socialists cast illegal votes for Hillary!"" Fear is what they're showing, and fear is what America is tuning in for.It's fuckin ridiculous. The amount of knee jerk irrational hatred and paranoia that rules this country. Of course, it's not a recent phenomenon. We were born out of fear and paranoia and hate. It's why we wiped out the natives. Its why we had to fight a civil war over black slavery. It's why we banned certain ethnicities or nationalities from coming here. It's why we had Jim Crow. It's why we interred Americans of Japanese descent in concentration camps. It's why an entire generation is repulsed by the word ""socialism"" meaning we can't have universal healthcare and not be burdened for life for choosing to go to college.But I guess there's one thing we don't fear. We don't fear gun violence. Columbine didn't make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Aurora didn't make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Virginia Tech didn't make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Fucking Sandy Hook didn't make us afraid enough. Las Vegas didn't make us afraid enough. Parkland, Florida won't either. Because the fear of more restrictions on gun rights is greater than the fear of a gun's right to restrict life I guess.So. Is this what the fuck America is? Have we, particularly those on the right, decided that we need to be constantly afraid, clutching to our AR-15s against mostly imaginary and vastly overblown threats, while the REAL threat, the merchants feeding you this fear and paranoia, drag us further into the dark?

Standing at a podium and mourning the murders of schoolchildren is only a starting point. The rally I went to in Kansas City had every single speaker mention voting. When we marched, some of the chants we shouted were reminding people to vote.Motivating people to take action is a big part of this, and it's working. That's why the right is so scared right now.

I was aware of the original version, yet I didn't read this as satire but rather as fake news. Now, if this were drawn as an editorial cartoon a genre we're almost universally familiar with, then we'd quickly categorize it as satire. We know what to expect with the genre. But, who expects a CGI'ed imagevideo to be used for satirical purposes? Few, I imagine. And this speaks to other genres, like satirical news TV programs. Some people took The Colbert Report as being a comedic, yet earnest right-wing news show making fun of liberals. There was no significant difference between the groups in thinking Colbert was funny, but conservatives were more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely meant what he said while liberals were more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements. httpjournals.sagepub.comdoiabs10.11771940161208330904So consider the genre and the audiences familiarity with that genre before claiming others should immediately recognize this as satire . . . if it were ever meant as satire in the first place which would take knowing the creator's intention.",32,crowdsourced,2018-03-27T13:02:59Z,,0.19,0.16,0.14,0.17,0.18,0.16

8a9xwl,,"This number is patently false. As has been pointed out in this thread and elsewhere, this is the same set of bastardized statistics from the Gun Violence Archive that was reposted from HuffPo two weeks ago. It was wrong then and it's no less wrong now. The GVA counts four dead teens in a Brooklyn familial homicide even though only one teenager was killed. Four people died in total, but not four teens. And one was the murderer himself. Another counts a dead 17-year old man who died during an attempted armed robbery, a felony, and was shot dead by his would-be victim. It's sad the guy was stupid enough to try his luck and get killed, but he died during the commission of an armed felony and he was stopped by a law-abiding gun owner who may have very well saved his own life by using his own gun in legal, justified self-defense. Lumping him in to inflate a statistic for a political motivation is why people don't trust news and can't think critically. If you comb through the stats from GVA, you'll find the same disturbing trend. Calling a grown, adult criminal who willingly robbed someone at gunpoint and died as a result of a self-defense shooting a ""teenager killed by gun violence"" is patently dishonest and in bad faith.I posted a quick breakdown of some of these stats in a previous thread, back when HuffPo cited the same number from GVA two weeks ago.

March 13, 2018 Midland, MI - A 16 y.o. kid with a history of mental issues steals a gun and then engages police in a shootout. He had made off-hand remarks to his own family about his desire to commit suicide by police.4. March 9, 2018 Fredricksburg, VA - after stealing a car and a .45 caliber handgun, a juvenile suspect was killed in a shootout with police after they responded to multiple reports of burglary and drive-by shootings5. March 9, 2018 Kansas City, MO - A victim is killed in a drive-by shooting with no age given, but this is still counted among the 73 teen deaths6. March 5, 2018 St. Louis, MO - a 17 y.o. kid committed suicide in the bathroom of his high school7. March 5, 2018 Kissimmee, FL - a 39 y.o. woman kills her 17 y.o. daughter and then kills herself8. March 14, 2018 NYC, NY - 4 people are found dead in a likely triple-murder suicide by a 27 y.o. man. Among the dead is a 16 y.o.9. March 4, 2018 Durham, NC - 17 y.o. man is killed when he and a friend attempted to rob another man at gunpoint and he is shot and killed. The shooter was cleared of all charges as the shooting was deemed to be in justified self-defense.10. March 3, 2018 Cherry Valley, IL - two boys, a 14 y.o. and a 12 y.o. are killed in a double-murder suicide by their father in their home. This is counted as three teen deaths, despite the fact that the third death was the father.11. February 28, 2018 Rankin County, MS - a 23 y.o. man kills two female acquaintances, a 17 y.o. and an 18 y.o. over a ""card game""12.

February 26, 2018 Fresno, CA - a 21 y.o. man is killed when his car exchanges fire with another car in what police suspect is a ""gang-related"" incident Again, this is counted as a teen death.14. February 26, 2018 Arlington, TX - a teenager is injured when a 46 y.o. woman shoots herself in the chest15. February 26, 2018 Converse, TX - A 17 y.o. is shot in the front seat when an acquaintance in the backseat attempts to take a ""package"" from him. Police are unsure if drugs were being exchanged, but marijuana was found in the car.16. February 25, 2018 Jackson Twp, OH - a 16 y.o. and a 17 y.o. are shot in a possible murder-suicide17. February 23, 2018 St. Louis, MO - a 15 y.o. is killed by his father in a double-murder suicide. This is counted as three teen deaths. 18. February 25, 2018 - McComb, MS - a 13 y.o. boy commits suicide19. February 24, 2018 Jackson, TN - a juvenile who had escaped from juvenile custody and had an arrest warrant for criminal impersonation kills another teenager after illegally acquiring a firearm20.

8a9xwl,,"However, I do not see a need for high-capacity, assault-type weapons to be made available to the general public.I understand your comment and the meaning behind it. I do have to ask, is this really such a huge problem that we need drastic change to fix? What percentage of the US population are killed by ""high capacity assault-type weapons? each year? What percentage are killed by handguns?If you wanted to save the most lives, you'd be advocating for the removal of handguns instead of ""high capacity assault-type weapons."" Or, even the removal of swimming pools, since they kill more people in the US than AR-15s.But, it's not about logic, is it? It's about emotion. Large capacity assault-type weapons are scary, and your movement is based on fear, not on logic, so you go after what scares you the most, rather than what is actually the most impacting.If you want to ban ""scary looking guns,"" and you get the majority of legislators to agree with you, you'll prevent the use of AR-15 type weapons from taking about 100 lives per year. We can't know if those same lives will simply be taken by Glock 19s or Colt M1911s, instead, though. Opportunity costs notwithstanding, it's very possible that you won't save a single life, just shift which weapon is used to commit the homicides.If you manage to make every single privately owned firearm in the US illegal, you'll likely save a few thousand lives. Out of the 33,000 lives that are lost using the firearm as a tool, 20,000 of those being suicides, maybe a third would live instead. That's a worthy goal but at what cost?Switching to AI driven cars will save as many, or more, by making it ilegal to drive one's car. No more distracted driving, no more lives lost to drunk driving. Worthy goal, right?Making it illegal to self-administer pharmacueticals would save twice as many, since prescription drug abuse kills many more people than high capacity assault-type weapons do. Are you writing your legislators about this? Are you marching to take away our rights to handle dangerous drugs? why not, if you want to save lives?

Even if the FMR didn't apply, it's still likely going to be first-degree because the intent to kill the witness is still there. What the FMR does is it transfers the intent to commit the felony to any consequence of their felonious conduct in this case, murder.Your example is still accurate. If the surviving robber were to escape and hold out for a while, the only murder they could be charged with would be their accomplice's.

You could get stuck in a ditch in a rural area and have someone stop to offer to attach a winch to pull you out or otherwise check on you in no time. But in a different context where they're watching TV at home they'll have no empathy at all for their enemy liberals, even if they're just kids.I have a deeply conservative aunt who will go to Maldova every year on her own dime to help a desperately poor orphanage. She along with my uncle adopted 4 kids from a very troubled home and did their best to raise them to adulthood the oldest is only at the mental level of about a 5 year old due to terrible neglect by her birth parents and still lives with them. They can both be some of the nicest, most compassionate people I know and the least empathetic at other times. It boggles my mind. It's like Jekyll and Hyde.I don't think it's just American conservatives. If a set of people fall into your 'enemy' group, empathy can drop off a cliff even if you're an otherwise nice, intelligent person. We have to each be constantly vigilant to not let that happen on a personal level. Otherwise you can start throwing them all together and let your antipathy towards all of them grow which definitely won't lead to anything good.

7xz9ja,,"I've been reading about gun laws in the Czech Republic, and it sounds like really sensible measures to protect gun ownership while also making it a highly regulated process. .To own a gun at all - you have to pass a written exam, practical exam, medical evaluation, psych evaluation, and a criminal background check. Everyone has the right to have guns, but you have to meet all the criteria first. All guns are marked, registered, and you bear a degree of responsibility for accident or misuse.And there are different tiers of permit granted depending on what criteria you meet, and what your needs are. A- firearms collection B- sport shooting C- hunting D- profession E- self defenseYou have to provide a case for needing a gun for whatever kind of permit you're applying for, self defense being the highest degree of ownership..I'm gun owner myself, carry concealed most of the time, and a supporter of the right to bear arms.But there needs to be rules for this stuff, lots of rules. And from what I'm reading about the Czechs, sounds like they're doing a lot of things right. They're an example of a country with plenty of legal gun ownership, but statistically low gun violence considering that they don't practice a complete ban on private ownership.",29,Catshit-Dogfart,2018-02-16T17:27:00Z,,0.20,0.11,0.29,0.06,0.18,0.16
7xz9ja,,"You will obviously get rage filled pushback at the mere thought of giving up weapons, as clearly a Bill of Rights written in the late 1700s gives everyone the ""natural right"" to own guns. Times are different now, and while I do agree with the right to bear arms, I believe it is a right that should be highly respected and earned, and not just a blanket free for all. I'm willing to agree with you though. Guns do not get treated with the respect they deserve. Anyone who fully understands the life altering power a gun has, should also understand the need for stricter and deeper background checks when purchased. No one is taking away their rights, no one is denying their due process, no one is coming to their house and taking their currently owned weapons. All we want to do is make the process of obtaining a gun carry the weight and gravity equivalent to the power and importance of owning that gun.Everyone talks about gun restriction laws taking away their 2nd amendment rights. They seem to conveniently forget that at some point their 2nd amendment right begins to infringe of my right to life, liberty and the persuit of happiness. So which comes first?

It is very obvious that the majority of these 17 ""school shootings"" were nothing of the sort, and the writer is pulling shit out his ass to pad his article.

Anyone with a history of mental illness, in which the illness can cause violent or irrational behavior, or anyone currently on psych meds that have side effects that can cause violent, irrational behavior, should automatically be disqualified from gun ownership.I also have no problem with slightly more rigorous testing, both written, and physical demonstration of firearm knowledge and safety, before being able to own a gun.Lastly, in a related debate, banning ""semiautomatic assault weapons"" does not make any sense. For those of you who are not knowledgeable of firearms, this would still leave equally as powerful weapons on the shelves. Example the ruger mini 14. A hunting and ""ranch rifle"". Literally the only differences between that and the dreaded s AR15, are some plastic parts, hand grips, and small parts that attach to the end of the barrel. None of which affect the ""deadliness"" of the gun. They shoot the same caliber round, at the same velocity, with a difference of only fractions of a second in how quickly each round can be fired.

8dqfgi,,"You said my guns were more important to me then saving kids lives so that would imply that I actually own a gun wouldn't it?All you did was list a bunch of laws from other countries. What does that have to do with America? Please outline a policy that would work in America to reduce mass shootings andor the murder rate that doesn't violate the 2nd amendment. If you want to talk about straight up banning guns, that's a completely different conversation.Yes, mass shootings all but ended in Australia after they took their guns but it's not exactly like they had a lot of them before that. Not to mention the violent crime rate went up in both Australia and the UK after they banned guns. So if your goal here is to save lives, banning guns doesn't do much of anything. Evidenced by the fact that Britain now has a knife problem to the point that the London mayor wants to ban knives.See, you're starting from a point of misunderstanding of gun owners. A gun is a tool for self-defense. A way to protect yourself and your family from harm. You want to take the right to defend your life away from people. The main basic right of every creature on this planet. What's someone supposed to do against someone who breaks into your house and is trying to hurt you or your family? Call the cops and hope for the best? Do you really trust the cops to protect you and your family? They don't even have a constitutional obligation to protect you. The only person you can count on to protect your life is yourself and I refuse to force people to outsource that job to the government. Remember, law enforcement are the people who repeatedly failed the kids of Parkland High and allowed that murderer to carry out his plans. These are the people were supposed to trust our lives to? The way that Sheriff Israel went on TV and refused to take responsibility while blaming the NRA was disgusting. Their incompetence and lack of action caused the deaths of those children, not the NRA. This idea that the NRA controls Congress is ridiculous considering the fact that the amount of money they give them is miniscule compared to other groups. The NRA gets its power from gun owners and pro-gun congressman are pro-gun because of their constituents, not the NRA.

8dqfgi,,"Well, if you look at the list of mass shootings and massacres in Australia they don't have a separate page of school shootings like America does, hmm, I wonder why that could be, you'll see that since they enacted their gun control laws after the Port Arthur Massacre, there have been 14 mass shootingsmassacres. If you look at America's page of only school shootings, you'll see there have been 17 incidents since the beginning of 2018 alone, including one today the 20th. Now, I don't claim to be a math teacher, but I'm fairly certain 14 incidents over the period of 22 years is much less than 17 over a period of 4 months. But I'll let you do the math for yourself, just in case you want to check over it. Please show me in the constitution where the govt is given the power to limit the peoples rights to own guns.One, it's the government's job to protect its people, so if the people are being senselessly murdered, the government is supposed to step in and protect them. Second, that's a goofy argument that can be taken very far out of context pretty easily. The Constitution also doesn't say you shouldn't murder children in schools, so why bother doing anything about it? Just let those kids be murdered, right? Of course, even if you could find that clause Id still have the right to own a gun simply as an extension of my ownership of my body and my property.""Prove me wrong. And even if you do, I'm still right, because I say so."" Nobody denies that you should own guns, the idea that the government wants to take away all your guns is a phantom illusion that Fox News and the NRA have planted in your heads. Literally the only thing that the left wants, is for the right to stop screaming and having a tantrum and come to the table so that the talks can start on what should be done to prevent the murders of children. Nobody will get everything they want, but a compromise can be reached, but compromise onky works when both sides sit and talk.

Automatics would be a real pain and require about what they do now. Pistols would require a permit and yearly or twice yearly training and safety classes.

Because I moved down pretty nicely, pretty quickly, and we had bullets flying right over my head after I went down. So Im glad I went down.

They saved the two, and they were really hit tough, both of them equally.Elon Musk 0545Yeah.Donald Trump 0545And my first question was, because I heard bullets flying over me and I said, How many people were killed? Because we had a massive crowd there, a tremendous, thousands and thousands of people. And there was no land. It was all people. So I said, How many people have been killed? Because I knew there were other shots being fired. And they said, We dont know yet, but some people have been badly hurt.

Unfortunately, the reality is that many departments are understaffed, especially in those areas that they are needed most, and they have to make tough calls on where to go when.The second is we don't want officer's actions constantly guided by the fear of lawsuit. When responding to a dangerous situation, we don't want the officer to act on a fear of potentially being sued if he or she makes the ""wrong"" decision. Instead, it should be based on their training and analysis of the situation at hand and free from external distraction.Of course there are going to be outlier cases where these two concerns don't seem to play a role.

I'll be god damned if there's shots going off or an active shooter and I'm not one of the first guys through that door. That's what we fucking live for. That's part of why I signed up for this job and that's what you should expect of us.Sure that deputy may never get punished for his dereliction of duty but I hope he never wears a badge again in his life. He doesn't deserve it. There are plenty who have died trying to protect innocent people from evil and he disrespected each and every one of them. People died because he was scared.

Military bases have a lot of guns in vaults, but aside from Military Police, people typically aren't allowed to carry guns. Only in 2016 did the Pentagon permit military personnel to carry private sidearms, subject to the approval of their Commanding Officer.EditMilitary bases have more GGWGs than most other places, but in the context of the GGWG theory, they don't have that many more. As many people have pointed out, one shooter can do a ton of damage even if the GGWGs respond to it right away. At Ford Hood, Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and injured 32 more in 10 minutes, even though nearby police responded to it right away, because the GGWG response time on a military base is not meaningfully different than the response time in most civilian settings.True believers in the GGWG theory would say that every law-abiding citizen should have guns, so that the response time is immediate. So the argument thatthe GGWG theory is dumb because military bases have more GGWGs yet still suffer from shootingswould not convince them. They would say that, if only everyone at Ford Hood was armed, Hasan would've been stopped before he did much damage.To be clear, I am not one of those true believers in the GGWG theory. I think it would be completely insane and impossible to equip everyone with guns the rational thing to do is to restrict everyone's access to guns.I was just pointing out thata saying military bases have more GGWGs isn't really a valid counter-argument to the GGWG theory, since the GGWG theory demands almost-universal possession of guns by good guys, not just a few moreb the average military personnel is not allowed to carry guns, in case civilians who read that comment think they are.",1351,deleted,2018-02-23T12:53:38Z,,0.15,0.12,0.23,0.14,0.18,0.18

Constable Son was stationed at the front entrance when he spotted the man entering with a concealed rifle. The constable lunged to gain control of the firearm, but it discharged and struck him in the leg. Drawn to the Rotunda by the noise, Corporal Malo and Constable Thom took cover and exchanged several rounds with the gunman after he entered the building. Constable Létourneau tracked the gunman down the Hall of Honour toward the Library of Parliament and fired at him several times. RCMP Sergeant Rozon, Corporal Daigle and constables Barrett, Bergeron, Bubelis, Célestin, Fraser, Marcoux, Palmer, Ruest and Waye, who had assembled outside the Peace Tower, entered the Centre Block. Supported by their colleagues, Sergeant Rozon, Corporal Daigle and constables Barrett and Fraser assumed a tactical formation IARD as they charged down the Hall of Honour. With the shooter now cornered in an alcove leading to the Library, Sergeant-at-Arms Vickers, after being advised of the shooters location, dove to the floor in front of him and fired his weapon.

Keep in mind, this place was about the size of a football field and had only about a 6 foot wall for a perimeter. I was in a small makeshift wooden building on the side of the FOB, unable to see outside at the time. The explosion and following report from the small arms fire was so out-of-the-blue for me, even in a combat zone, that I didn't even realize we had been attacked until well after it was over. It's difficult to describe what I thought it was at the time, like a generator had exploded and the automatic fire was reverberating metal from the force of it or something. At any rate, I was trained to use my weapon, which was always in ""amber"" status on that FOB, full magazine, but bolt forward with no round in the chamber but I was not ready to even recognize the threat, much less respond to it. To say that any teacher would be able to react in a cool manner and neutralize a threat in a learning environment where such a change in the environment would shock the system in such a way as to render someone almost incapable of moving is ridiculous.

7zn6x0,,"There's an absurd scene in tombstone where Wyatt earp under heavy fire has had enough and while he and his fellow fighters are pinned down he storms up and marches out into the middle of standing water no less and yells in slow motion ""nooo"" and single handedly turns the fight and shoots many bad guys including the main villain.Absurd but it actually happened at least according to those who were there. Historians recount that what made Wyatt earp special wasn't that he was some fast on the draw gunslinger like you see in the movies but rather he had this incredibly rare ability to remain calm in a gun fight. It was this that gave him a distinct advantage. Even out in the open and in more than one shootout Wyatt Earp was able to calmly take aim and fire upon his opponents. His opponents maybe seeking cover just didn't usually have the same nerves. So even at close distances they'd miss or shoot more haphazardly. That's what made him a legend. I guess having balls of steel.But Earp was a complete outlier in his ability to remain calm. Even others who had experienced shootouts couldn't just stand out in the open and calmly take aim as bullets whizzed past them. And that's the truth with all of humanity. Most of us have this fear of dying and inherently dangerous situations. Some like Earp can place it out of their mind and do the job they need to. No amount of training can prepare one I don't think to overcome these instincts. They can lessen them to some degree but people are only human.I think most studies have shown when confronted with an armed assailant even those who are armed themselves tend to react instinctively to either take cover or flee. Many and perhaps most don't even think about returning fire. Many don't even consider that they might have the possibility. That's because it's pure instinct kicking in to survive and in such situations most don't think or plan out their actions. On top of that most don't have the time to react if they wanted when surprised by an assailant. Even if they did remain calm and reach for their weapon they're often too late. The person planning on killing others by surprise has a very distinct advantage. Add to that most also won't shoot very well because they're acting defensively and too nervous and you have a very uneven gunfight.That being said guns carried by people have saved lives in the past. An armed teacher might stop a killer short of killing more. But that teacher might shoot other by mistake. That teacher my accidentally shoot another not during a killing spree. That gun might get stolen. That gun might cause all forms of terrible trauma. It's a stupid idea that what we need are more guns. The one thing we seem to know for sure is that the more guns there are floating around in society the more people get hurt or die from them. In fact when the settlers first started crossing over to the west they'd heard terrible stories about native Americans and armed themselves to the tit. There were far more deaths from settlers accidentally shooting themselves crossing the country than anything that ever came close to an attack from a native American tribe. Guns are dangerous we don't need more of them.And so knowing the inherent danger excess guns pose to society that's why men like Wyatt Earp would ask those who were armed to turn over their guns while in town. That's what he was doing in the gunfight at the O.K. corral, attempting at first to disarm the cowboys.",26,trivial,2018-02-23T13:00:37Z,,0.18,0.14,0.16,0.16,0.20,0.16

First of all, policing is a profession for some and a lifestyle for others. I don't think anyone becomes a police officer thinking that they won't go -and get that shooter, but many don't. I ran past officers into the building and they were seriously frozen in fear. They couldn't get out of a sentence or process what was happening. Some of these guys were badass officers on the street. For me, everything felt fake. Even as I was stepping over bodies looking for the one or more gunmen, it felt like a super realistic training scenario. It was loud but I couldn't hear anything. Every corner I took I could've been killed, but it just didn't seem real. I wasn't thinking about my wife or my family, just looking for the shooter. That is something that not everyone can turn on and off and frankly unsettling looking back. I knew i needed to go in. I couldn't let my coworkers down and I couldn't let the people inside down. When I first went inside i made peace with the fact that this was probably it and that's the last I thought about it. I couldn't have lived with myself if I didn't go in and this shooting didn't even involve kids. That would've been way tougher. I don't blame this officer for not going in. You go in to that building expecting to die. You follow the sound of the gunshots right into the fight. He probably has a better gun and more ammo.

Ive always known this. Ive always heard this discussed in groups of like minded individuals who carry for self defense. To hear the NRA now use this idea shows me what Ive always known, the NRA doesnt represent responsible gun owners. They represent gun manufactures and it just so happens their interests align with gun owners. Arming teachers, while at the surface, can appear like a good idea to prevent this violence, its not. To properly increase the odds of a teacher or school staff of successfully navigating the confusion of an active shooter situation, would require training, more training then what Im sure would be provided. This isnt something that can be trained for once a year. You need to run drills constantly until its muscle memory and you react properly like its instinct and even then, you can still get it wrong.

Putting yourself in a position to defend yourself and those around you, but don't go looking for trouble is a reasonable response.I agree that arming teachers on the surface seems like an easy solution, but is only treating the symptoms of the larger problem.

7zn6x0,,"There's a pretty interesting Twitter thread being circulated on this whole thing just don't visit the blog linked in the user descriptionhttpstwitter.comTheLastRefuge2status966854507744374784Quoting 1. Watch this video. People don't understand how Broward County School Sheriff Officers operate. I'll explain.2. I spent about 18 months in 2012, 2013 and 2014 investigating Broward and Miami-Dade school policies and how those policies transfer to law enforcement practices.3. My interest was initially accidental. I discovered an untold story of massive scale and consequence as a result of initial research into Trayvon Martin and his High School life.4. What I stumbled upon was a Broward County law enforcement system in a state of conflict. The Broward County School Board and District Superintendent, entered into a political agreement with Broward County Law enforcement officials to stop arresting students for crimes.5. The motive was simple. The school system administrators wanted to ""improve their statistics"" and gain state and federal grant money for improvements therein.6. So police officials, the very highest officials of law enforcement Sheriff and Police Chiefs, entered into a plan.7. As soon as Miami-Dade began to receive the benefits political and financial from the scheme, Broward County joined on. The approach in Broward was identical as the approach in Miami-Dade.8. It's important to remember, this was not an arbitrary change - this was a well-planned fundamental shift in the entire dynamic of how teenagers would be treated when they engaged in criminal conduct.9. The primary problem was the policy conflicted with laws and over time the policy began to create outcomes where illegal behavior by students was essentially unchecked by law enforcement.10. Initially the police were excusing misdemeanor behaviors. However, it didn't take long until felonies, even violent felonies armed robberies, assaults and worse were being excused.11. The need to continue lowering the arrests year-over-year meant that increasingly more severe unlawful behavior had to be ignored. Over time even the most severe of unlawful conduct was being filtered by responding police.12. We found out about it, when six cops blew the whistle on severe criminal conduct they were being instructed to hide. The sheriff and police Chiefs were telling street cops and school cops to ignore ever worsening criminal conduct.13. The police were in a bind. They were encountering evidence of criminal conduct and yet they had to hide the conduct. There were examples of burglary and robbery where the police had to hide the recovered evidence in order to let the kids get away without reports.14. The police would take the stolen merchandise and intentionally falsify police records to record stolen merchandise as if they just found it on the side of the road.15. They put drugs and stolen merchandise in bags, and sent it to storage rooms in the police department. Never assigning the recovery to criminal conduct. Stolen merchandise was just sitting in storage rooms gathering dust.16. They couldn't get the stuff back to the victim because that would mean the police would have to explain how they took custody of it. So they just hid it. To prove this was happening one of the officers told me where to look, and who the victim was.17. At first I didn't believe them. However, after getting information from detectives, cross referencing police reports, and looking at the ""found merchandise"", I realized they were telling the truth.18. A massive internal investigation took place and the results were buried. Participating in the cover-up were people in the media who were connected to the entire political apparatus.19. The sheriff and police chief could always deny the violent acts assaults, rapes, beatings etc. were being ignored that's why the good guys in the police dept gave the evidence of the stolen merchandise. That physical evidence couldn't be ignored and proved the scheme.20. From 2012 though 2018 it only got worse. In Broward and Miami-Dade it is almost impossible for a student to get arrested. The staff within the upper levels of LEO keep track of arrests and when a certain number is reached all else is excused.And it continues.

7zn6x0,,"At the Alexandria Congressional baseball shooting last year the shooter opened fire but two officers, Davie Bailey and Crystal Griner armed with only pistols and in a terribly open position were able to save countless lives simply by providing return fire to pin him down. It seems in these situations the best response is to provide any kind of armed resistance, it doesn't have to be a SWAT team. While I disagree with the idea of arming teachers I think that police policy needs to be updated to reflect the fact that often these shooters are not looking for a firefight and will often kill themselves or hunker down when engaged. It is unfortunate that this police officer failed when the time came, he is only human after all, but I don't think I can ignore that he could have likely saved many lives if he had taken literally any action. The myth that he was worthless against a AR-15 with a pistol is proven false with the Arlington case.",27,Rajjahrw,2018-02-23T13:35:55Z,,0.10,0.11,0.22,0.16,0.19,0.21

The army has no farms. The army has no factories. The army has no fuel refineries. Abroad, the US Army is a huge threat because they have a continent's worth of resources and manpower to just pour onto the situation. In the US mainland, every city they bomb is now not only hundreds of thousands of citizens they have to provide for, but also hundreds of millions of dollars per year in taxes they're not getting.Additionally, in the logistical nightmare event of a homeland oppression situation, they cannot force me to go to work with a drone or tank.

Whereas most gun free zones are not controlled environments, this one will be packed with guards, metal detectors, etc. In such a controlled environment, making sure the USSS knows the identity of every carrier IS the safest situation for the Vice President.However, a gun free zone with no guards or metal detectors is extremely unsafe for the VP.

In that case, no metal detectors, uncontrolled environment, no guards it would actually be SAFER to allow LTC-carrying citizens to carry.

ALL firearms must have their firing pins removed and they are inspected to verify this, and ammo is absolutely prohibited as a safety measure because you have thousands of people handling each firearm, and if you allowed live guns and ammo you would be creating an increased risk of a negligent accidental shooting.The concern is not that someone would take a firearm in to commit a crime, it is just to reduce the risk of an accident in an environment where people are extensively handling firearms rather than simply having them holstered all day. Most gun shows have the same rules, as well as gun stores and ranges.At the range I used to run, our rule was that firearms could be brought in completely unloaded and in a case, and had to be inspected by a staff member to verify, or they could be brought in carried concealed, in which they had to remain absolutely concealed and in their holster until you were in a bay on the range. If someone holstered in a gun for gunsmith service, we would take them into the range, have them remove and clear it there, before letting them return to the store.",5,dancingferret,2018-04-29T19:18:31Z,,0.15,0.18,0.19,0.12,0.18,0.17

Named after Republican assemblyman Don Mulford, the bill was crafted in response to members of the Black Panther Party who were conducting armed patrols of Oakland neighborhoods while they were conducting what would later be termed copwatching.1 They garnered national attention after the Black Panthers marched bearing arms upon the California State Capitol to protest the bill.234 AB-1591 was authored by Don Mulford R from Oakland, John T. Knox D from Richmond, Walter J. Karabian D from Monterey Park, Alan Sieroty D from Los Angeles, and William M. Ketchum R from Bakersfield,5 it passed both Assembly controlled by Democrats 4238 and Senate split 2020 and was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan on July 28. The law banned the carrying of loaded weapons in public. 6 Both Republicans and Democrats in California supported increased gun control. Governor Ronald Reagan, who was coincidentally present on the capitol lawn when the protesters arrived, later commented that he saw ""no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons"" and that guns were a ""ridiculous way to solve problems that have to be solved among people of good will.""

The video is something to give them something, anything, that they could plausibly use to justify their disparaging statements.The goal isn't truth, the goal is to fightdisparage the people they perceive as their opponents. One of the most effective ways to disparage your opponent is to try and frame your opponents strengths as a weakness. So in the case of the survivors of a school shooting, the alt right try to frame them as being responsible for a school shooting. They're trying to undercut the legitimacy of their opponents.It makes a lot more sense if you think of it as two warring armies rather than people having a discussion. The members of the side launching the attack only care if it's damaging and effective and hurting their opponent.

87v1t4,,"Side note One of the links inside the article is to a really good article from The Atlantic, written by a 13-year radiologist in a busy nearby Florida trauma center, on how radically different the AR-15 gunshot wounds are from the typical handgun wound she sees In a typical handgun injury, which I diagnose almost daily, a bullet leaves a laceration through an organ such as the liver. To a radiologist, it appears as a linear, thin, gray bullet track through the organ. There may be bleeding and some bullet fragments. I was looking at a CT scan of one of the mass-shooting victims from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who had been brought to the trauma center during my call shift. The organ looked like an overripe melon smashed by a sledgehammer, and was bleeding extensively. How could a gunshot wound have caused this much damage? The reaction in the emergency room was the same. One of the trauma surgeons opened a young victim in the operating room, and found only shreds of the organ that had been hit by a bullet from an AR-15, a semiautomatic rifle that delivers a devastatingly lethal, high-velocity bullet to the victim. Nothing was left to repairand utterly, devastatingly, nothing could be done to fix the problem. The injury was fatal.... I have seen a handful of AR-15 injuries in my career. Years ago I saw one from a man shot in the back by a SWAT team. The injury along the path of the bullet from an AR-15 is vastly different from a low-velocity handgun injury. The bullet from an AR-15 passes through the body like a cigarette boat traveling at maximum speed through a tiny canal. The tissue next to the bullet is elasticmoving away from the bullet like waves of water displaced by the boatand then returns and settles back. This process is called cavitation it leaves the displaced tissue damaged or killed. The high-velocity bullet causes a swath of tissue damage that extends several inches from its path. It does not have to actually hit an artery to damage it and cause catastrophic bleeding. Exit wounds can be the size of an orange. With an AR-15, the shooter does not have to be particularly accurate. The victim does not have to be unlucky. If a victim takes a direct hit to the liver from an AR-15, the damage is far graver than that of a simple handgun-shot injury. Handgun injuries to the liver are generally survivable unless the bullet hits the main blood supply to the liver. An AR-15 bullet wound to the middle of the liver would cause so much bleeding that the patient would likely never make it to the trauma center to receive our care.... As a doctor, I feel I have a duty to inform the public of what I have learned as I have observed these wounds and cared for these patients. Its clear to me that AR-15 and other high-velocity weapons, especially when outfitted with a high-capacity magazine, have no place in a civilians gun cabinet.",429,JuDGe3690,2018-03-28T21:34:49Z,,0.14,0.17,0.18,0.17,0.16,0.17

They have been in continuous meltdown ever since.Hypocrisy aside, it's a good indication of the political threat they perceive from the post-Parkland gun control movement. The long-term prospects for the extremist views of movement conservatives on gun regulation do not look good....The best Republicans can offer is stuff like what former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum proffered over the weekend learn CPR instead of ""looking to someone else to solve their problems.""For one thing, it's deeply telling that in reality, a hypothetical elementary school combat medic trying to save their homeroom classmates from grapefruit-sized high-velocity rifle wounds would be most concerned with staunching bleeding, not CPR. Conservatives can't even get their transparently bad faith deflection arguments right.And that is why they are largely reduced to smearing and defaming a bunch of kids trying to participate in American democracy. It's the only political move they have left.But more importantly, by refusing to accept even slight compromise in the gun debate, conservatives have made their position extremely brittle. After Parkland, public opinion has shifted fast in favor of commonsense regulations like universal background checks, a national gun registry, and reversing the ban on government-funded gun violence research. Meanwhile, fanatical anti-Democrat partisanship from the NRA is purging out the last vestiges of pro-gun sentiment from that party. If and when Republicans lose their grip on national power, new gun control measures are liable to go much further than they would have if the NRA and Republicans had accepted a tactical retreat.It will serve them right.",49,The-Autarkh,2018-03-28T20:07:26Z,,0.09,0.24,0.18,0.15,0.14,0.21

They ARE making the debate less civil. These teenagers are calling the opposing side ""child murderers"". Guys like David Hogg are putting up price tags conflating the deaths of school children with the money Marco Rubio gets from the NRA. It's beyond ridiculous.Because the teenagers hyperbolically suggest that the NRA is basically fine with clockwork massacres of schoolchildren, if the alternative is modest regulation of gun manufacturers or restrictions on gun purchases.By ""modest"" gun regulation you mean outright banning large swaths of firearms? And the focus is on rifles. If your end goal is to save lives, rifles account for about 3 of firearm murders. Four times as many people are killed with knives as they are with rifles. It makes ZERO sense to start your gun control push with rifles. That's part of the reason the pro-gun side is so critical of these teenagers and the gun control crowd in general.

85kk0s,,"Do you actually want the answer, or are you asking rhetorically?If it's the former, it's honestly pretty simple. Your conception of how military force works is mistaken. For quick reference - I served two tours in Afghanistan in an infantry battalion in the sticks. I have long-term experience being a member of a modern military trying to put down a determined insurgency fought by poorly-armed partisans. I only mention that because I don't want you to think I'm talking out of my ass here, I did this professionally and have studied it pretty extensively both in the military and out.Here's where you're going wrong You imagine the military as being united during a civil war.This is a major factor, and understandably, it's a mistake a lot of people make. You're used to thinking of the military as a unified block representing the government's legitimized use of violence. In the event of a civil war, however, the military would not remain united. I cannot possibly emphasize enough how much the average infantryman would resist orders to even so much as confiscate arms from the civilian populace, much less forcibly occupy their cities. You have to understand - the people who plan on fighting back in the event of tyranny are the people whose kids serve and who've served themselves. The combat arms branches are overwhelmingly southern working-class who trust the government a hell of a lot less than you do. Yes, that is bizarre and contradictory, given their profession. The American infantryman is a complex animal, outside his love of strong drink and obscenity. Think about what happened in Syria part of the military stayed loyal to the state, part actively joined the resistance, part deserted and went to guard their own homes, and part stayed in to work as saboteurs. Thinking a civil war would be military vs. civilian is a false premise it would not be. You drastically overestimate the effects of a technological advantage.This is usually the crux of the argument. ""What can your AR-15 do against a drone?"" Nothing, of course. If the government wanted to smash every populated area in the US into dust, they could do it and it would be hard to stop them. That, of course, would also lose them the war as another major power would immediately step in to our shattered shell of a country and set up shop. You can't win wars by bombing, full stop. In my second deployment we shot literally tens of thousands of artillery rounds and dropped thousands of tons of bombs, and this was in a rural area where we had complete command of the air and high ground. We killed plenty of insurgents. Unfortunately, killing insurgents is about eighth on the priority list of ""things we need to do to win a COIN war."" It's often actively detrimental because when you kill a guy who has eighteen fighting-age cousins, a few of them are going to join right up in his place. We're never going to win there. We can drop five times more bombs every day all day for the next ten years and not a thing will change. Boots on the ground are mandatory for occupation. Check it out, man - we fought people who were armed with ancient Enfields and improvised explosives. Your average gun-owner in the US is at least as well armed as any given Talib and many are much, much better and well-trained on top of that. It is basically impossible to crush an insurgency by force unless you're all right with simply leveling the place. If the government wants to win a civil war, it can't level the place by definition. You're ignoring the advantages of the ""other side.""There are a hell of a lot more veterans than there are active military, and to reiterate, the majority of active military would desert at least and likely outright defect. I am telling you from personal experience - a hundred million armed people are far more than enough to stop ""the might of the most powerful military in the world."" Far more. The difficulty alone in convincing US troops to engage American civilians on American soil on behalf of the federal government...

Yablonsky estimated that there were 200,000 full-time hippies in the United States who were both conspicuously identifiable as hippies and had dropped out of mainstream society. In addition, Yablonsky estimated that there were another 200,000 teenyboppers, part-time hippies, and ""weekend hippies"" who might go to high school, college, or a ""straight"" day job, but participated in hippie culture on an occasional basis.

85kk0s,,"I'm sure this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but if we want meaningful and effective gun legislation, we have to start by acknowledging that in some regards, the NRA members are right. In the hands of a responsible and well educated person in the realm of guns, a gun is not a danger to others accidental shootings happen, and I will address those later.The easiest way to fix the issue of gun violence in America would be to take away all the guns. If there are no guns, you can't shoot people, and by making them so scarce it becomes very hard for criminals to get their hands on them and commit crimes with them. But we shouldn't pass legislation because it's easy, we should pass legislation because it's effective and right and fair to all our citizens. Taking away all the guns is not fair to responsible gun owners. We need legislation that still allows the right people to own guns, and stops the wrong people from gaining access to them. We also need legislation that helps stop people looking to commit suicide from gaining access to firearms to easily, because that costs us a lot of lives every year. With that in mind, what kind of legislation could we implement to achieve these goals? We could start by mandating that to purchase a firearm, you have to gain a license. To gain this license, you would have to pass a test, similar to a driving test, that requires you show knowledge of gun safety, gun handling and that you have a gun safe with enough storage space to house all your firearms. You would be required to keep a tally of all your firearms at your home and on your person when you are carrying the firearms so you can properly report it to law enforcement should a firearm be lost or stolen from you. Edit Following another reditor's suggestion, in order to ensure ease of access to all people regardless of background, we can provide a program to facilitate transportation to the facilities where this testing would be done. You would also have to pass a psychological evaluation. A series of questions designed to establish your mental health, and a number of sessions with a therapist to ensure that you're not a danger to yourself and others. You would be required to attend sessions with a therapist on a regular basis maybe once a year, but let's not get hung up on specifics to ensure your continued good mental health. I also happen to believe this would be beneficial to society as a whole if more people saw a therapist, but that's another issue entirely. In the spirit of the second amendment's well regulated militia, you would be required to attend on a regular basis maybe every 6 months, maybe every year, but again let's not get hung up on specifics a training camp with other gun owners in your local area. During that time, you would go over gun safety, gun handling and marksmanship with other like minded individuals. This would help create a sense of community and give people in that community a chance to evaluate other gun owners in the area, and perhaps surface concerns about the ability of a person to properly handle their guns, their character or their mental health. A little bit of self regulation might help avoid some disasters. All of this would be financed by taxes on guns. Of course, there will still be accidents, and their will still be people that will slip through the cracks and commit horrible actions. That is an unfortunate side effect of allowing people to own guns, but people die in plenty of other leisure activities, and accidents happen every day. We cannot stop all of them from happening, but I believe with proper legislation we can still allow gun owners to own the guns they want, and protect most people from the kind of horrible acts we've seen.",7,Edril,2018-03-19T18:06:26Z,,0.16,0.14,0.22,0.16,0.17,0.15

85kk0s,,"Well, what your typed seems reasonable. But history shows that these are just used to deny the right. ""We could start by mandating that to purchase a firearm you have to gain a license.""Please read this and see how anti gun politicians go out of their way to try and prevent you from exercising your right. httpswww.washingtontimes.comblogguns2011oct5miller-emily-gets-her-gun She went through the hoops... You can see they just tried everything to make it difficult. And places like San Diego have made it so you can't exercise a right, unless you are politically connected.... Same with NY. In fact, I think there was just an arrest made in NY about a guy ""selling"" access to gun permits. ""You would also have to pass a psychological evaluation.""Well, for starters... Good luck finding a mental health professional to sign off on this. One of my hobbies is skydiving. This has been brought up as part of a screening for students.... You know how many mental health professionals were willing to sign that a guy was OK to jump? All you need to do is ask pilots about the FAA medical process and get their opinion on it to know why this will not work. Next, you know that Cruz PASSED a mental health screen... Right? You know that the Pulse shooter was investigated and passed... Right? You know that the Fort Lauderdale Airport shooter tried to turn himself in... Right? The Isla Vista shooter was in therapy and the police were sent ot check him out, he passed. The Fort Hood shooter was KNOWN to have issues with his co-workers who were all mental health professionals. I could go on and on and on. ""In the spirit of the second amendment's well regulated militia, you would be required to attend on a regular basis""The Supreme Court has ruled that it is an individual right unconnected to service in a militia Heller, 2008. The militia cause gave A reason, not the reason. For example, they didn't mention hunting because that was as common as going to grocery stores today. It didn't need to be mentioned as a reason. The militia was controversial still is and that is why it was mentioned by name. And the Constitution Bill of Right's actually mentioned this in the 9th Amendment ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.""So just because hunting was not mentioned... Does not mean it is not protected. What would actually save lives is looking at the actual situations. For example, why didn't the FBI act on Cruz? When the Fort Lauderdale shooter turned himself in, why didn't the FBI do anything? When the Pulse shooter was under FBI investigation, why did the FBI not find anything? Why did the Dark Knight shooter not get Baker acted? One very specific thing would be to put a temporary ban on ownership for people kicked out of school for behavioral problems. One thing I noticed, and that made me respond to you, is that you had ideas, but ALL of your solutions made innocent people who want to exercise a right jump through a bunch of hoops. I am not for rules that target and inconvenience 99 of the population when there are actually easy options that will target those who ave shown through their ACTIONS that they should lose a right. Example... Drunk driving is a problem. I would NOT suggest that every car in the US have interlock devices. That would be putting obstacles and costs onto innocent people who have done nothing wrong. I AM fine with crushing people who get DUI's. This is what lowered DUI deaths in the 80's. Don't get me wrong, interlock devices on ALL cars would save more lives... But is that something you would support? And the VAST majority 61 of ""gun deaths"" are suicides. Out of the 34000 number thrown around, about 21000 are suicides. I don't blame the rope when someone hangs themselves, I also don't blame a firearm. So that leaves 10-12K deaths. The majority of those are related to crime. And we have a VERY long history of not punishing criminals who use guns. Google ""Byron Champ"". He is a felon that was caught with a gun... Know what sentence he was given? About 8 months of boot camp... Not prison, boot camp. When he got out of boot camp, he was later involved in a gang shooting in a park. But please, don't take my word for it, look it up for yourself. You want to actually stop gun deaths?1. Gun education in schools. Why is it that to prevent DUI's, pregnancy, STD's, drug use..Etc, we claim education is the key, but on guns it is not? 2. Arrest and actually punish criminals who use guns. If you are a violent felon and caught with a firearm... Why would you ever be let out of prison again? You have shown to have zero interest in rehabilitation. 3. When we KNOW a guy has mental issues... Put them in care. The vast majority of mass shooters had KNOWN mental issues. They all expressed violent tendencies, many were kicked out of schools, etc. Why were they not taken seriously. Now, when you do all that, I will gladly look at other options if they don't work. But why should I agree to jump through a bunch of hoops well intended when we don't do anything about criminals and those with mental issues? If I don't reply, well, it is because I get down voted so much here that I can only post once every 9 mins.... And I frankly am not going to try and reply once every 10 mins... too much time out of my life when I know all I am going to get is down voted more.",8,SSMDive,2018-03-19T20:26:38Z,,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17

Also put a minimum draw length and draw poundage on triggers to make rapid semi-automatic fire less accurate by requiring a stronger ""jerk"" on the trigger.

The NYPD has the same high-poundange set up on their pistols, which is why they have events like the 2013 Empire State Building shooting, where a guy shot a coworker on the street, the NYPD responded, fired 16 bullets, and hit 9 ! bystanders. There is no planet where inaccurate gunfire, especially from people who want to defend themselves or othersIn school shooting type scenarios, accuracy at 100 meters doesn't matter when you are armed and unopposed.

Your statement is so generic that it is damn near meaningless. Ban accessories and modifications that improve shooter efficacy, including things that increase the rate of fire bump stocks, doublestrike capabilities, improve handling under high rate of fire and in various positions pistol grip, improve weapon maneuverability verical forward grip, and aid in faster target sighting ACOG, holographic, and powered sights and scopes. Also put a minimum draw length and draw poundage on triggers to make rapid semi-automatic fire less accurate by requiring a stronger ""jerk"" on the trigger. That won't eliminate mass shootings, but could help make them less common and help reduce the casualty count by making less-trained shooters less effective. There is so much bullshit in this.

I suppose you could also mandate reloading systems that require more finesse to use, which would make them tougher to reload in stressful situations. So not only can't we hold guns or aim them, we can't reload them. Also improve mental health services in the US, which are frankly atrocious.I agree. And the economy, the stigma surrounding seeking mental health care even if you don't have any mental illness, promoting education, and a few other things that address the reasons why people turn to violence to solve their issues rather than more reasonable measures.

Yes, that includes everything political from the mainstream to the edgy and fringe like fascism and communism. Good point. They are trying to influence both sides. But one side is 30 times more likely to amplify Russian trolls and bots. One side has been actively undermining ongoing federal investigations into this psychological warfare by the Russians. One side stands by as sanctions to punish this action are not enforced.If we are to do anything to combat this via both passive and active measures, we need to get remove the willfully complicit GOP.

I don't know if this subreddit will downvote me or not, but a lot of people have said it feels like a forced agenda was pushing the kids in certain directions.Most people can't even recall the Florida survivors faces but the the girl and the guy.

There was a crap ton of people there yet none of them really got interviewed much nor spoke their minds on the subject. I just wish the Las Vegas shooting would of been the turning point for guns as it was more a perfect set-up.I don't even know what any survivors of the Las Vegas shooting look like but that was the worst shooting in history and yet it was dropped quick as hell when it was the perfect time and opportunity for all this discussion. Only difference here is that it was a high school and they had some kids who wished to speak their mind. I never complained this shooting got too much coverage, read my thing once again. The whole point I was making was rather than using the same few faces, why not swarm the media in numbers of people who survived the shooting. Wheter you agree with me or not, there's a good chunk of people who feel it was a huge propaganda effort and using kids to further an agenda. When you use a lot more survivors it's abit more difficult to call it propaganda and it gets the point across on just how many lives were effected by this.Las Vegas was a perfect storm yet the ball was dropped.

Our president is a loudmouth buffoon on twitter. These kids are trying to combat that. I didn't give a shit about anything other than hanging out with my friends and finding ways to be alone so my gf and I could have sex. Politics was no where near the forefront of my brain.I'm 32, but I'll admit that even 3 years ago, I didn't give much thought to politics, only cared about voting for the right people and policies. I was hardly as passionate as I am about it now though. I assume it's the same for these teens. I don't find it wild that they're also arming themselves with more information than teens would have in the past. Have you seen what Teen Vogue has been coming out with lately? They need to be paying more attention to the world around them, and I'm glad that they are.

A person could work a blue color job, be able to buy a house and take 2 weeks vacation with their family and save for retirement with dignity. America lead the world in technological innovation, we sent a man to the moon using pencils and graph paper. We invented amazing things. Taxes on the top 1 were at 90 on dollars over 400,000 per year which in todays money is about 1.8 million. So people who made fuck tons of money would reinvest in their own companies, or start new companies, boosting the economy. The government was able to build a national highway system and new bridges and tunnels. Colleges were cheap, and in many places tuition was free. California, and New York City and State schools. A kid could work a job part time and afford to go to college without being 100,000 in debt that they could never pay back. We funded the arts, invented Rock and Roll, and the world looked at us for moral leadership and for the most part we did ok. Sure we fucked up in Vietnam and Korea. Republicans and Democrats agreed on basic facts-- they debated like intelligent statesman for the most part on how to proceed based on facts. We cured horrible diseases like Polio. We went through the civil rights revolution, sure an ugly stain on our history but the people prevailed and we as a nation became better for it.

My mother barely pays attention to politics outside of what's on the news. I don't remember her saying anything about Newtown when it happened, or about any other mass shootings outside of ""man this is fucked up.""During our last phone conversation, she brought up the Parkland shooting. She sounded very distraught and talked about how ridiculous it is that this kid was able to get an AR-15. Then she started talking about solutions and how the government needs to do something to prevent this from continuing to happen. I've never heard her talk about politics in such an activist way, and especially not in a way that disagrees so much with Republican orthodoxy. Hell, I'm Facebook friends with a lot of very Republican people from my hometown and many of them have the same attitude. One Republican woman has a newborn baby and is basically begging for gun control because she doesn't want her kid to get shot at a school.The fact that Parkland is a high school in a predominantly white, affluent area can't be overstated. It's a major factor in why this particular mass shooting is having so much more of an impact on the gun control debate than previous mass shootings. The GOP's failure to act on this shooting will continue the demise of its suburban popularity.

7yzawl,,"Before you downvote me please consider leaving a reply so we can discuss..._We need less guns in the country. Period.Right now we have something akin to three a gun for every person alive in the US and that's completely unnecessary. That's not to mean that every single person has a weapon but that a small percentage of the population has more than one and is essentially hording weapons. Three-percent of the population own's around 133 million weapons.My friend owns multiple guns and hardly ever hunts. He has more than one hand gun, a rifle and a shotgun in a gun safe. I may not be as close with him as I once was but I trust the shit out of him with a weapon only because I've known him for over a decade and served in the military with him. That being said I think it's absolutely ridiculous that he has so many weapons he doesn't need that many and honestly he enjoys collecting guns. This is the mindset that is poisoning our country this thought of gun worship and gun collecting.This isn't the only reason for the over-saturation of weapons however but another reason would be the ease of access to purchasing especially through sales in gun shows. There should be more restriction on purchasing weapons from a gun show as it's far to easy to get them now.Another thing that should probably change is more access and use of mental health programs everyone always just says ""We need better mental health"" but just saying that doesn't fix anything. My idea follows along with what the military does and goes like this1. When you go and get your weapon permit you should have to undergo a mental health examination to show that you aren't showing red flags of mental instability.2. One should have to renew their permit once a year and part of the renewal process would be a checkup on the persons mental health even if they showed no flags in the original assessment.2. If one did show red flags during the original assessment they can still purchase weapons but under the condition that they undergo periodic therapy sessions over the course of a year and upon the next renewal of their permit if the flags are gone then they can stop taking the therapy. 3. If one fails to pass a mental health examination they will not be permitted to carry a weapon and will be offered mental help before being able to undergo examination again.The military does something similar to this but does not go near as in depth they simply put out a survey of 100 or so questions to gauge how a soldiers mental health is but it's extremely easy to lie on those and nearly everyone does lie at one point or another on it.This strategy wouldn't stop people from owning weapons unless they were deemed mentally unstable and even those people would be offered help and re-evaluation at a later date.Edit Changed to a more recent correct? statistic",40,PMMEURCRITS_,2018-02-20T20:48:29Z,,0.18,0.10,0.21,0.14,0.19,0.18

I'm honestly unsure about that.Also, how detailed would the initial check be?It wouldn't have to be an hour long therapy session I don't think. You could have a pretty quick screening in half an hour that covers the basics. ""How often do you drink. Is there history of abuse in your family"" etc etc. Obviously if you're caught lying you lose your permit and pay a fine.Where are you going to find enough mental health professionals to administer the testsBefore you get your permit process finished you could have the applicant go out and either find their own professional to do an examination or the government could provide one.

Rubio could have generated a very different reaction from the crowd, and could have been cheered, had he said and done the right things. This was not a roast or a political smear - it became a disaster for Rubio when he let everyone know that his political voice and power were for sale. But I respect the guy for going out there and listening to these kids, and despite ungodly amounts of social pressure, still he stood up there and held his composure and answered their questions even if they were unpopular. And I appreciated him trying to explain why the issue is more complex than people make it.Him being answerable to his constituents is the bare minimum - he gets very little respect from me for doing one of the most basic things his job entails. Admittedly, he's better than the cowards who didn't appear, but not by much. What is different between the ar15 and a Glock 19 or Walther p22 in the case of a school shooting?Rate of fire, magazine capacity, bullet caliber, and ease of concealment. All three factors would have impact on the killing spree in terms of number dead or injured, severity of injuries sustained, and the ease with which the gunman would be able to avoid detection or defend themselves from a counterattack. What would have been different? Nobody brought this up last night...not a student, not a parent, not Jake, and not the politicians. The sherrif wasn't booed despite dodging the home visit of 39 times question. He then tried to make the NRA lady act like she was making it up when it was in the news. The whole point of law enforcement and the FBI acting on information is to fill in the gaps when all other checkpoints fail in this process. The community , students, and teachers did everything right. The background check, the mental health check, and law enforcement failed in this.The point the sheriff was trying to make - which the pro-gun talking head wouldn't let him say by constantly interrupting him - was that the laws are not adequate. The NRA has actively lobbied to make it easier for people to acquire guns and make it harder to take guns away from people who have them even if they are a clear and present danger. You're demanding law enforcement do things they lack the authority to do, but then when we suggest giving them that authority you and the NRA prevent those laws from being created.",27,GearBrain,2018-02-22T16:19:25Z,,0.16,0.16,0.19,0.16,0.17,0.17

8531bw,,"A valid question.No single one of us can or should have the ability to take rights away from others, in general.However, there are a lot of instances where we traditionally accept and depend on the ability to control rights for individual and collective safety- We give our police a monopoly of power such that they can detain criminals, administrate justice, and ensure safety in general. This means in many instances they can take rights away. We jail murderers, take away licenses from drunk drivers - we have even agreed as a society to take away the right to vote from prisoners.- In other cases, we have set up checks and balances before I can fully practice our rights. Yes, I have the right to drink alcohol, but we as a society have decided I need to wait until 21 to let people exercise that right. Yes, I have the right to own a vehicle and drive it however, as a society, we have decided that I need to pass a set of driving tests before I get to hop behind the wheel.At the end of the day, the rights we have as a nation were decided upon by people. We have extended rights in the past through amendments. Women now have the right to vote. So do people of color.We have also taken away rights in the past when society came to realize change needed to happen. We decided that an individual's freedom was more important than the right to own slaves. At one point we decided to take away the right to buy and sell alcohol not the best decision necessarily, but it was a decision we made nonetheless. As an individual, I don't have the power to deny you your rights - and I wouldn't want to have that power either.As a society, however, we need to occasionally come together to reflect on where we're at.

l7ryo6,,"""Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. - J. P.

Proponents of repealing the 2nd Amendment and banning guns altogether are a minority even on ""the left.""The most detailed data I've found in looking at this issue by ideology is the 2014 Pew Political Typology survey. Here's a chart showing the dataBanning guns except for law enforcement was only favored by 16 of people identified as consistently liberal based on questions to classify their ideological subgroup. Likewise, only 18 of those identified of mostly liberal favored that position. The most popular position among both groups was ""most should be able to own guns, within limits"". This position was favored by 65 of people who were consistently liberal and 49 of those who were mostly liberal. 14 and 31 people in these groups favored less control, respectively.Although there's been an increase in support for gun control since 2014, banning all guns remains a decidedly minority position. Procedurally, it would be basically impossible to repeal the 2nd Amendment in any event. Even if one could somehow get 23rds of the House and Senate, there's no way to get 34ths of the states.

88js9u,,"""Unfortunately, incidents are virtually certain to recur so long as the first line of monitoring and compliance policing is performed by armed officers.In short we must disarm most police officers.The Castile shooting occurred at a stop due to a broken tail light. Consider the city of Chicago uses cameras to asynchronously ticket red light violators. Running a red light is objectively more dangerous than driving with a broken tail light, but Chicago will allow you to continue driving unimpeded after doing so.Further, consider any number of other violations in Chicago --- expired plates, bad stickers, poor selection of parking places, failure to pay parking fees, outstanding warrants on your car --- are performed by parking enforcement officers who are not armed. Chicago also routinely deployed traffic direction officers who are themselves not armed.The police force we have today will not allow itself to be disarmed. The realistic medium-term answer to this problem is not to change the culture of existing police --- we should do that, but we should be pragmatic about how far that will get us. Instead, cities that want to reduce police violence should stop hiring assault officers, and begin programs to replace them with monitoring and compliance officers who will accept jobs with a description that includes doing the work unarmed. Smart cities should find ways to offload monitoring and compliance work from assault officers onto unarmed officers. Police forces can be disarmed through attrition.Cities are incentivized to do this anyways assault officer hires come packaged with intractable pension problems. New job descriptions don't.Consider also ""armed"" and ""unarmed"" isn't binary. When approaching Philando Castile's car to inquire about the broken tail light, the officer was by default no more than 20-30 seconds away from being able to fire a bullet into Castile. Smarter public policy can increase that delay from 20 seconds to something far greater. For instance general-purpose patrolling assault officers can be are, in fact, today issued rifles and shotguns stored in their trunk. Those officers can remain armed just, not with handguns, and not wielded by default.Modern assault officers are in a double bind. They're routinely required to work in high-crime neighborhoods, often minority-dominated, and thus subjected to constant cognitive strain they're put into contact with far more minorities at work than at home, and those minorities are sampled from a cohort anomalously likely to include criminals. Further, assault officers are acculturated and in fact trained to believe irrationally that routine job activities, like making traffic stops, are among the most dangerous things that can be done in America. They're stuck in a vicious circle of cortisol spikes and negative reinforcement. It is not reasonable to expect them to safely handle continuously-available firearms.I suspect we'll discover that confrontations between unarmed officers and armed suspects are less dangerous than confrontations between armed officers and armed suspects. Most not all suspects who shoot at cops aren't doing it out of spite, but instead of out self-preservation. Regardless, I think we already know what would happen if we reconstituted police forces to be 20 assault and 80 compliance, down from 90 assault far less police violence, far fewer shooting incidents, less expense, and a greater civic recognition of the real risks of policing.Disarm most police.""httpsnews.ycombinator.comitem?id12057079",28,Hamilcar218bc,2018-03-31T19:46:59Z,,0.16,0.17,0.17,0.16,0.18,0.16

Just five years after, its about 7 percent higher.

There could be some beneficial use of these guns, but overall the harm outweighs the benefit. And the harm comes in many different forms. For example, the Philando Castile case in St. Paul, Minnesota. After he was stopped by police, he immediately told the officer that he was a right-to-carry holder and had a gun, which youre advised to do. And then the officer shot at him seven times.

So there you have one household with three adults, but only one gun owner.The next thing would be the Statista survey you've linked. They've labeled the survey incorrectly. It isn't 42 of households have a gun. The original Pew survey said that 42 of people live in a household with a gun. Gallup did a survey that verified the Pew numbers. The actual number of people that own a gun is hard to tell. The government doesn't keep that sort of data and people have some reason to feel they should lie when asked. However, professional survey companies are pretty good at figuring out what the real number roughly is from the potentially bad data they have. Pew and Gallup both estimated the actual rate was between 29-30. About 20 of the population owns more than one gun. A little over half the guns in the country are owned by 3 of the population.So less than half of all Americans live in a house with a gun in it. A little less than a third of all Americans are gun owners themselves. About 15th of the US population own multiple guns though that is a majority of gun owners.

My question is why the current text of the Constitution is the end of any discussion?The Constitution has an intentionally built-in means to modify it through amendments, the phrase you quote being part of one such amendment ironically. It seems like the older the Constitution becomes the more ""sacred"" it becomes, as though to change it is to somehow defile it.If the writers of the Constitution recognized that a mechanism to amend it was wise, why is questioning whether an amendment should be considered or one's meaning reassessed ""totally unhinged""? Why should quoting a single phrase out of the Constitution be considered the end of the discussion, when clearly the writers anticipated and allowed for changes, and such changes necessitate discussion?",10,ThinkRationally,2018-03-21T17:38:07Z,,0.05,0.13,0.46,0.11,0.12,0.13

8kgxu5,,"Foreigner here.I would guess that close to 100 of the rest of the world would clearly see that gun ownership is the problem here.It is my belief that, at some point in the perhaps distant future, guns will just exist with hunters and target shooters - and with them under strict control. Why? Because the alternative is demonstrably corrosive in a developed country.The issue is really how you move to a better place and take the majority of the population with you as you go. This needs to include a majority of current gun owners.Lets look at some relatively non-contentious issues .....- No guns for any kind of criminal- No guns for any person with significant mental problems- A cooling off period between purchasing a gun and receiving it- No weakening of what should be Federally imposed restrictions by any State- The rules related to gun safety and storage need to be strengthened. They need to be matched with stiffer penalties for non compliance- There needs to be legislation that reduces ads that glorify or make popular gun ownership - just has been done with cigarettes There are no doubt other soft options and it seems these could be worked on immediately when the current political madness ends. Law changes that were seen as reasonable would be widely acceptable.But there are also the more entrenched opinions that need to be worked on slowly and thoughtfully. Minds need to be changed and that may require generations. Here are some thoughts at how things could be moved slowly forward for particular views.The Second Amendment Where does this say anything about the type and number of weapons that can be owned? There needs to be some reasonable restriction on a the type and b the number that a NEW gun owner can have. These can be as unrestrictive as you like to start with. It is the concept that there can be control in these areas without removing reasonably judged second amendment rights. There is then the potential to slowly tighten these restrictions as and when the changes can be widely accepted.They want to take away my guns It needs to be said clearly that this will not happen. Restrictions articulated above relate to new gun owners only. However it seems to be that it is reasonable that certain categories of guns need to be registered and again reasonable that the owner pays for that administration. 5 a year and some paperwork would deter some. The State offering to buy back guns at full commercial price would chip away also.I need to defend myself I think because there are so many guns in existence in the US that this is a reasonable position for the foreseeable future. However there is a position for some sense here. As things slowly tightened, the number of people showing messianic fervour for guns would slowly diminish I believe. I, and the rest of the world, see such people as total losers. That view needs to become more commonplace within the US. With changes of social acceptability and tighter controls, the school and other shootings will diminish to levels seen in other developed countries. Unfortunately that change will be slow. Years of inaction or worse by the GOP have doomed thousands of children.The one thing that shouldnt be acceptable to reasonable people is the status quo.",6,BadgerPhil,2018-05-19T11:24:59Z,,0.14,0.16,0.21,0.16,0.16,0.17

I think incresed background checks would be a good place to start, and I don't have any problems with the idea of licensing requirements, you need permits to own ""Class III"" weapons, what's the issue with extending that to other firearms? Safety courses. I think you should have to prove you have taken a firearms safety course before purchasing a firearm, where's the outrage when you need to take a hunters safety course to go bow-hunting, I don't see any reasonable problem with requiring one for ownership of a gun. Hell, make it an elective high school class! I always hear about the right trying to take money away from schools art programs, why can't they pump some money into schools for a safety course? It seems like a no brainer to me for the record I do see the risks of having a political organization teaching in public schools, I'm just spit balling here.These are just a couple ideas, and they certainly are not original ideas either, but they deserve to be examined. I don't know if any of these suggestions would have prevented yesterday's massacre, but I really do believe some of these ideas, if implemented responsibly, could reduce the number of firearms related fatalities in the US. Ranging from accidental to cold blooded murder.I really don't claim to have the answers, I am just some dude on the internet, but I think I've heard some good ideas many still need to be worked out, I just don't think we should ignore ideas because they may be somewhat inconvenient. The 2A is important to many Americans, myself included, I absolutely DO NOT want to see it go away, but something needs to change. Our forefathers laid the groundwork for what would become one of the greatest nations in world history so far and other nations have looked to our system to try to emulate it. Some of those countries have done a fantastic job of it, because they see the shortcomings in the system. Our constitution was written so it could be changed, the founders realized that would be a requirement for our lasting survival. We, as a nation need to realize that by not adapting our laws to an increasingly rapidly changing world we will or already have fall off our position as an example to the world, we will become a backwoods.I'll stop my ramble now.",6,kufunuguh,2018-05-19T08:29:30Z,,0.18,0.16,0.19,0.15,0.15,0.16

If you want to have a gun you need to get a licence first that is at least as difficult to attain as a drivers licence is. Then you need to demonstrate you have a valid need for a gun. Self defence shall not be a valid need. Recreation is also not a valid need. Then after all that you need to demonstrate you have the ability to store and track your guns safely. Such as a locked gun safe. And anyone who registered they have a gun shall allow themselves to be subject to auditing that they are following the law.

As the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press noted, The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held that the press cannot be punished for publishing or broadcasting truthful information of public concern that the press obtained legally. The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly made it crystal clear that it is the governments burden to safeguard information ... that does not belong in the public domain, the coalition wrote in a brief filed Tuesday. It is not the medias burden to refrain from publication. ...

I think we should listen to what they have to say. I also think that they are too close to the issue to think clearly about it. That doesn't mean that what they have to say isn't important. Screaming at people that they don't agree with like children isn't helping their case any though. I don't think they know what they are getting into. As soon as you become politically active, you are signing up for your private life to be politicized. I wouldn't rely on any adult other than their parents informing them of this, and in most cases I don't think a parent would know to inform their child that this is an issue.

That said, I can't even imagine the level of gun control that would be needed to prevent school shootings. I'd think it would pretty much have to be an outright ban, which has zero chance of happening. Also, it would have to be national, because it's trivial to cross state lines. Now, supposing you have a national ban on guns... it's impossible to ban the supplies needed to make pipe bombs or other devices that are as or more destructive than guns.We absolutely should have restrictions to try to keep weapons out of the hands of the mentally ill and people who have otherwise shown they can't be trusted with weapons. Republicans like to say all the shootings are caused by mental illness, but then refuse to pass laws that attempt to address weapons getting into the hands of the mentally ill presumably because that would prevent most Republicans from buying guns.All of that said, our kids will live long enough to be seriously impacted possibly even killed as a result of climate change and the follow-on effects of it.

At the time the reasoning was that States should have their own defense forces and a national standing army of any meaningful size wasn't embraced. But it clearly is designed to prevent the federal government from imposing restrictions on the keeping or storing of weapons of war, but individual states could still do whatever they wanted.However, with the 14th amendment Northern abolitionist Republicans thought it was feckless and ludicrous for states to be suppressing the guarantees of liberty granted in the bill or rights that were supposed to be civically aspirational and extended to black folks after the Civil War, and many of the authors specifically intended thatt black people being able to be armed for their own protection was one such guarantee. In terms of actually caring what the Constitution and its amendments say, there are really only two choicesa For some reason the 14th amendment doesn't incorporate the 2nd, the federal government if prohibited from an awful lot of gun regulation, and not incorporated, it's largely left to the states or b It is incorporated and both state and federal goverment have very limited abilities to impose regulations on guns.Other options are largely dishonest, sans the Constitutional Amendment angle, which is so hard to do that those who dislike guns have actively avoided advocating for it.That said arguments about the 2nd are weird because the original language should be viewed as keeping the federal government from imposing on the states side-loaded on top of the idea that many citizens would naturally be armed and prepared to cope with foreign invasion, etc., it being similar to how things were handled in some of the few regions of Europe to avoid or resist monarchy at different times.

93j8fp,,"...exists so that as a last resort people might rebel...This doesn't tend to be backed up in writings of the authors of the Constitution between one another. Their focus was more on the dangers of a standing professional army much like the one we have today and the ability to mobilize such an army in order to defend western frontiers, which they knew would soon be under threat for encroaching into native American territories. Territories promised by the British Crown to remain under indigenous control. Many of the authors of the Constitution, leaders of the Revolution, had ties to land speculation in the Ohio territory and west of the Appalachians, land in which the British Army would not offer any protection. But a standing army was seen as a marker of tyranny, especially since they had all gone to great efforts to highlight it as such. So what was needed was a way to ensure the land would remain protected, without the need for a standing army. Without the need to pay and feed troops in perpetuity. What better way than to make it clear that all citizens have the right to arm themselves in the formation of militias? Militias which could be rallied overnight to strike back at native villages and secure new lands with force.I think it's also useful to look at how the early administrations of the US responded to rebellions, uprisings or revolutionary moments. The Whiskey Rebellion is a handy example, though it ends rather anti-climatically. The short version is that frontiersmen were upset about a tax implemented under Washington's administrationor, wait, wasn't no taxes something this country was ""founded on""and they refused to pay. They gathered in arms and threatened government tax collectors and President Washington responded by leading an army of 13,000 troops a drafted army, at that, wasn't there something about conscription being bad... I can't remember to face some 2000-odd rebels. Here was a man largely seen as the center of the Constitutional Convention and he was saying, in his actions, that an act of rebellion against the government arguably an act similar to that which led to the independence of the country he now presides over is unacceptable. Hamilton, as well, his Treasury Secretary, pushed hard for any and all captured rebels to be tried for treason and hanged. He was quite disappointed when Washington later pardoned the two men found guilty of treason before they could be hanged.Similar, too, is the Civil War. Though Lincoln and his cabinet had nothing to do with the writing of the Constitution. It serves as an example that the government's stance, despite being guided by the founding document, is not one that says citizens have a right to attempt to overthrow their government. The US Government has always acted to preserve its own power and authority over its citizenry.All of this is to say that is you want to own a gun for the purpose of repelling government, that's fine and dandy, but the government is never going to approve of that justification. The government seeks to protect and strengthen itself. Gun ownership legal or otherwise is a danger to the citizens of a nation, not to the government of that nation, otherwise this issue of the second amendment would have been taken care of after the Civil War. Note that in none of these occasions did anyone argue that the guns were the problem, but the rebelling was the problem. I'm not telling you to give up your gun or to make any pleas for ""common sense"" reforms which is the emptiest rhetoric I've EVER heard. Hell, I'm right there with you. Let's all get guns and convince our military buddies to jump ship and let's overthrow the state and have a truly liberal society free from the tyranny of government. But let's not delude ourselves thinking that any governing document grants us any rights with the intention of rebellion.

Well, as it turns out, he's talking about the blood of rebels. We have had 13 states independent 11 years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century a half for each state.Alright, I'm not really a fan of this kinda math, but I see the point he's making.

It's worth a mention, though, that for him to see 11 years of 13 states he would have to start counting from the beginning of the Revolutionary War. And that seems a little unfair. The war ended just four years prior to this letter, which means, by his math, the states saw one rebellion in 54 years of peaceful rule. The rebellion he's referring to is Shay's Rebellion. But anyway, the new states are awesome, and can also totally handle whatever pitiful little rebellion of uninformed people may rise up to show how feisty they are.

On the one hand, if you're a free manwoman walking the Earth in America, then you should enjoy all of the natural rights which would include firearm ownership. But there are people who are mentally unstable and the issue of their health and well being need to be considered, especially if they are a danger to themselves or others.We need more discussions on the topic of mental health. Mental health is the root of this problem. It's the reason behind the man who shot-up Parkland. It's the reason behind the residents in Parkland's inability to do anything meaningful to prevent his horrible act. It seems there were many people who complained about the shooter's behavior in the days and years before his rampage, but most chose to try and persuade someone else deal with him, i.e. complain to police. It seems to me that the evidence suggests this was not the correct treatment by all parties involved in this terrible episode.",6,deleted,2018-08-01T02:02:42Z,,0.13,0.09,0.25,0.17,0.19,0.17

bx2kyd,,"Guy is a coward, but there is clear legal precedent that he is not guilty of a crime for failing to intervene. In Warren v. District of Columbia, the Supreme Court found that law enforcement officers do not have a legal obligation to provide police services in an emergency, and even more recently it was ruled that police are not obligated to protect a person in danger, particularly if it presents risk to their own life.He is, however, very guilty of perjury for lying about the events.Again, he's a coward and deserves public shaming, but his actions were not criminal until he lied about it.",108,TheMadFlyentist,2019-06-05T15:00:40Z,,0.04,0.29,0.17,0.15,0.25,0.10

bx2kyd,,"I had to second-guess myself for a second because both of those rulings did indeed stem from lawsuits, but I still do not think the state has much of a case here. He is charged with culpable negligence and child neglect - both of which are going to be very hard to pin on a school resource officer.Culpable negligence requires the state to prove that the defendant either exposed a victim to personal injury or personally inflicted that injury through negligence. This might apply if, for example, the resource officer was in charge of locking all the doors in the school and the shooter walked through a door that was left unlocked. There may be such factors that haven't been released to the public, but based on the info we currently have I don't think that applies to this situation. Culpable negligence is often loosely defined as ""failing to act when a reasonable person would have"", so the burden also lies on the state to prove that a ""reasonable person"" would have confronted an active shooter even at risk of their own life. The child neglect charge is even harder to make a case for, as the state would need to prove that the resource officer was somehow directly responsible for the well-being of the children and could be legally defined as a ""caregiver"". The administration of the school or even the individual teachers fit this definition much more closely than a school resource officer - at least in legal precedent.I do think the cases I cited above may be grounds for dismissal of the lawsuits against him, since as you pointed out they are rulings in civil cases.",8,TheMadFlyentist,2019-06-05T15:35:36Z,,0.16,0.11,0.24,0.19,0.17,0.12

83neoo,,"After police investigation, it was found that two boys had stockpiled weapons and had acquired gas masks and bullet-proof vests. The boys have since been arrested, but what really sticks out to me in the article is this section According to Brevard School District officials, the Titusville school investigated a possible threat on Jan. 10, 2017, after an art teacher at the school and other students told administrators that one of the two students was threatening to shoot people. According to a police report, the student told classmates that he was going to shoot his art teacher and hide explosives in the classroom. The report said he boasted students in the art room would ""be killed first"" and that he would use X-ACTO knives from the art room to stab them before turning a blade on himself. District spokesman Matt Reed said an initial internal investigation by the school, consisting of a few hours of questioning by the Astronaut guidance counselor and vice principal, cleared the student of any suspicions. School officials are trained to ask questions ""meant to reveal warning signs of mental illness, a desire to do harm or the means to hurt others,"" Reed said. The vice principal and counselor also interviewed some students who had overheard the threatening remarks. The guidance counselor at Astronaut, Monique Muldowney, told the art teacher via email that, after talking to the student, she did not believe the boy was threat. Vice Principal Jamie Russell told investigators ""he was typical goofy kid who wants attention and he did not believe the threats were that serious."" The art teacher responded saying the student has easy access to sharp objects in the class, and ""if he mentions anything of the sort again, I would like him out with no questions."" School officials did not tell district staff or its assigned security resource officer about the incident, and did not search the student's locker or backpack. The student did not have a history of disciplinary problems, according to the school district. At the time, it was not protocol to notify police or the security resource officer. Today, it is, Reed said, explaining that any perceived threat is now reported to police. By chance, Reed said, a few days later, the teacher who reported the incident mentioned it to her husband who worked at Parrish Medical Center, where a shooting had unfolded the year before, and he contacted the Titusville Police Department with the alleged threat.",48,KnowTheDifference,2018-03-11T15:44:25Z,,0.14,0.15,0.21,0.17,0.18,0.14

I'm just gonna copy something I wrote in Dec 2018 apparently it was about this very shooting! because I'm lazyU.S. courts have ruled, multiple times over the years, that police officers do not have a constitutional duty to protect people from harm. ""Protecting people from harm,"" in these cases, would have in a better world taken the form of enforcing a protective order against a husband before he kidnaps his three children from his wife and kills them, or intervening when a man on a knife-murder spree was attacking another man. Essentially, if you're being attacked in front of a cop, the cop has no duty to help you. Just today, a federal judge ruled that the school district and sheriffs office had no constitutional duty to protect students during the Parkland massacre.OK, well, that all kinda sucks, in my opinion. Honestly, it's infuriating.However, if that's really how it's going to be, then people need to be educated accordingly. In other words, I suspect that the average U.S. citizen doesn't currently realize that the courts have told cops, multiple times, that they don't have to protect people. The average citizen goes about their day assuming that if a cop were nearby, and they were in distress or getting attacked, the cop would help.

The sticky issue here is there are laws against using unnecessary force, but there aren't laws against a police officer abdicating duty and refusing to act, so it is completely reasonable to be angry in cases like these.

They won't pay for equipment, they won't pay for training, they won't bring the numbers up to allow proper response times,they certainly won't come up with the money to create a talent pool that allows scumbag officers to be written out of circulation in the desperate-for-headcount police forces around which they live, but one thing the local district will always provide plenty of, is blame whenever someone screws up or something goes wrong. That commodity is always in plentiful supply.Making laws requiring officers to go above and beyond the call of duty is literally illogical. Won't stop someone from blaming this lone officer for not being John Wick. But it's still illogical.",6,deleted,2023-06-30T00:19:54Z,,0.16,0.14,0.21,0.16,0.18,0.16

It has been reported in the shooters manifesto they talk about how they first targeted a nearby mall but changed their mind after finding out the mall had armed security. The school they targeted didnt have an SRO. There was an armed teacher, but the shooter didnt know that.The next level is having a visibly armed officer give commands. This is one reason police open carry instead of conceal. Say someone shows up to the school that isnt supposed to be there but isnt being violent yet. Like a parent that doesnt have custody but is in the office demanding they be allowed to take their child. An armed SRO can help get this person to leave just by being there. Some people only respect authority if they fear not respecting it will cause them bodily harm.The next level is pulling out their gun, aiming it at someone, and giving verbal commands. Say when that angry parent is told to leave they scream FUCK YOU, Ive got a gun and Im not leaving without my kid then reaches for their pocket. The SRO would then pull out their gun, point it at them, and give commands to put their hands up and get on the ground. If the parent already has the gun out then they will told to drop it. Imagine how well it would go if an unarmed SRO tried telling an angry, armed parent to put down a gun they have already drawn.The last level is actually using the gun. No SRO wants that to happen.

Theres one police for every 500 people. A person in that situation would not be able to stop all crime in a single room, let alone if those people were separated by miles and walls. Not to mention the fact that some of those police are criminals themselves. You have to protect yourself, and if thats the case I want the most effective tools for doing so. The p90 with its original ammo is probably optimal, but since I cant afford that, an ar15 for each person in my family will do for now.You can look at whats been happening in areas like Beverly Hills where gangsters are robbing people in broad daylight in one of the richest, most gun controlled areas of the country if you dont believe criminals dont follow laws. The cat is out of the bag, and no matter how many laws you make, you wont get rid of 20 million ar15s and the other millions of aks, sks, mini14s in existence. In fact, since the pandemic started, demand is outstripping supply for firearms. Even if the police could magically confiscate or buy back 10000 guns per day it would take 120 years to put a dent in gun ownership. In the meantime, all the guns would be owned by criminals.

He stood outside waiting for assistance while the neighbor told him to get in there and do something, ""he's gonna fucking kill her."" The cop said no, he needed to wait for backup because he was going in blind etc. And the neighbors said he was ex something air force or marines I remember it wasn't army bcuz I didn't know what it was att and he'd be the cops backup That they just needed to go in. Cop said no, we don't know if he has a gun in there.I yelled down that no he doesn't have a gun because he just pawned it the day before. And I asked him to help my mom. The cop looked up at me and said I'm sorry, I can't help you right now. Just hide. And I explained I already had and that I had tied my door shut via a ratchet strap to a nearby banister so it couldn't open out without breaking the doorstrapbanister. And I asked him to help my mom and that my dad was just drunk. He didn't use weapons.Cop looked me dead in the face and said no he was waiting for backup.

CAHOOTS workers responded to 24,000 calls in 2019 -- about 20 of total dispatches. About 150 of those required police backup.

ncyb2r,,"It's not impossible to fire shit or abusive teachers.Good administrators will document and work through how to remove or rectify bad teachers into better teachers.However most are shit, because they are concerned not with their current position but a future position. They are more likely to get that future position, if there wasn't a legal shit fight from someone trying to keep their job that cost money to carry out. Because even when shit is documented you can still end up in court.It's much easier to focus on driving school programs, results, etc which are positives for the school. Instead of worrying about firing a shit teacher and potentially hiring another one who turns out to be shit.Teachers also rarely circle the wagons if they think someone has done the wrong thing. Because it's easy not to pull the shit that most teachers would get fired for. For example I was sent a case study by my teaching authority the other weekNon US that detailed someone who was deregistered, by line 1, I had already said well that's not something I would ever consider. By line 5 it was pretty clear that the guy should be deregistered regardless of anything else that the document said.Police tend to circle the wagons, because some actions can be seen as something they might have accidentally done on a bad day. How many cops do you think have knelt on a suspects neck for an extended period of time?because I'd bet good money George Floyd wasn't the first to be treated that way. And some actions can be things that they think the repurcussions of will put them at an unecessary risk if they are allowed to stand. They might not give much of a shit that idiot 243 who was too trigger happy gets kicked off the force. But they may be worried that the precedent of him being kicked off the force could be used to remove them in a situation that goes wrong where they are acting out of fear for their life.",18,ArcticKnight79,2021-05-15T17:28:40Z,,0.17,0.16,0.22,0.16,0.18,0.12

b47uka,,"One of the things I want to see in America is people being encouraged to get counseling. Not just if you have a diagnosed mental illness, but for it to be normal. We don't really have the friend groups and third-places we used to. It's really easy to get isolated, to spin in place, and hear nothing but the echo of your own doubts, anxieties, and the lies that depression tells you. It shouldn't take tragedy to get help. It shouldn't be seen as a weakness to ask for it. I don't know what this young woman was going through, despite knowing this particular trauma, and it there isn't really good language for how sad it is that she ended up where she did. Suicide means your problems never improve. They just get outsourced to those close to you.

Speaking from some experience though, I didn't logic myself into the decision to commit suicide.I personally don't want to die, but I've had anxiety attacks to put full blinders on. Like terrible crushing rushes where ending it somehow cycles into your resolution plans. And when you couple that with depression, this inability to see or understand your own value, you don't think people will even be sad that you're gone. And this isn't real, everyone around you tells you they love you. You've got parents, kids, a sibling, a partner, a gamer buddy, or a pet, that wants you in this world.But something about that depression keeps beating the drum that you're more harm than good to people you care about. That you don't provide value and your role can be filled by someone better.Because you wouldn't be sad if you were stronger, or you wouldn't be having anxiety attacks. And back to those, holy shit - it's like your fight or flight response kicking into high gear but the only one to hurt is yourself and you're running from the idea of feeling this or anything. And you know, anxiety attacks pass. Hopefully you didn't take any actions you'd regret now that you can think clearly. If you're like me, maybe they caused you to yell or hit something. I've never hurt anyone else but I can see now how it happens - where a person gets overwhelmed and hurts someone else in the moment. I can also see how someone who is going through something that triggers an anxiety attack could look at a bunch of pills or a gun and think yes, this. I don't know if this girl had anxiety attacks or she was just depressed. I really don't know anything about her. I don't know if she made some plan and killed herself or something took her to that place of primal fear and she couldn't live a single second more feeling like that all the time.But I do know from my own recent suicidal thoughts that it's not thought out, it's just an impulse that you have to outlast. My doctor told me that it's your amygdala essentially sending a message to the rest of your brain that ""You're going to die,"" in a response to stimuli that logically might not make sense in people who end up with mental disorders.I'm sorry if this is a ranty way of saying that I agree with you, but it's complicated.",326,whats-your-plan-man,2019-03-22T19:33:07Z,,0.14,0.16,0.19,0.16,0.18,0.16

b47uka,,"I'm going to write this once and then copypaste it to the handful of people asking similar questions.No worries, pry away...I'm pretty open about my trauma and experiences.We holed up at the top of an open stairwell in a nearby hotel after conducting our 4 person exfil myself, my girlfriend now fiance and 2 other gal friends. We had zero information on anything, no data points other than we were all being shot and and everyone was being murdered and dropping hard hard to tell whom got shot and who was just diving for cover at times. One of our gal friends got on the phone once we were up in the stairwell and a guy she had just met that weekend decided he could get to his car and grab us on his way out of the greater combat zone. Things were still hot, no one knew what was going on, hard to tell if the bullets were still raining down because...well everyone was amped up, screaming and no semblance of control. I give credit to this guy, he could have got in his car and gotten out of the combat zone faster, but he spent precious moments picking the 4 of us up to get us all further away. We descended the stairwell, jumped some fences to get back into the hotel lobby jumped damn near a dozen fences that night. His car rolls up, he opens all 4 doors to his sedan and asks me ""Can you shoot?"". I tell him I can, I've taken a handful of pistol courses, done some time out at gun ranges shooting skeet and plinking. I'm far from a great shooter but I at the very least have some base knowledge. So I take the gun from him and tell him ""You drive, I'll shoot..."" So that's what we did, he drove. I had my gf and our friend in the backseat with me, I'm pushing on their heads with my left hand so they'll keep their heads down as low as possible. My head is on a swivel, coming up with rules of engagement on the fly to attempt to prep for combat. If A happens do X, if B happens do Y, if C happens...well we're all dead. In hindsight, we now know that Paddock was at this point dead in the 58th floor. But during that night, we had no information on whether it was a terrorist attack, whether it was 1 person or teams of people, if there were bombs, if they were mobile.Was it wreckless to give me a gun? No, at that moment it was literally life and death and I chose to take the gun and that I would kill if I had to. It's a situation as a civilian no one should ever find themselves in, but there I was...holding a pistol gauging every single car, every single person running.In hindsight, was having a gun more likely to get us in trouble? Yea that may be fair to say. Another ""good guy with a gun"" shows up and sees me with a gun and figures I'm part of the attack and opens up on us. That was a reality that could have happened, same goes for the reverse.Grabbing that gun, I flipped a switch that should never be flipped that says ""I will kill someone if I have to, I have the means and reason to do so, I hope I don't but I will defend those with me"". To be honest though, that's now part of my PTSD...flipping that switch. It torments me sometimes late at night and it's not something you just get to flip back and take back.",31,IW_SavageRoadhouse,2019-03-22T22:41:04Z,,0.14,0.18,0.20,0.13,0.19,0.17

b47uka,,"let me try and describe PTSD for you, and anyone else who has trouble understanding it, or who still loves to make fun of those with it as over-emotional exaggerating snowflakes.when you experience trauma you go into shock, which is a life-preserving mode where you don't emotionally process things at the time. You default to logical things that will save your life, even if later on you're guilted by others ""why didn't you do X?"" well, it's because at the time it would've heightened the risk of injurydeath, and not avoided it. You're a robot in these moments. It's why women told ""why didn't you fight back?"" when they're raped is wrong and illogical they didn't, because it would've likely got them killed by the attacker trying to silence them, instead of brought someone to the rescue. You do what you have to do to not die. It isn't a choice in that moment. Then after, the adrenaline wears off, and you really get hit with that shock you being to tremble and shake, your fingerstongue go numb, you may experience tunnel vision, and you often experience all the emotions you offset at once. You will cry, you'll get mad, or you'll hyperventilate or all three. The only thing to do is just work through it, hopefully with a friend. While this happens you'll re-live what just happened you'll experience it again and analyze it in your brain for mistakes, you think ""I should've done this"" ""why didn't I do this?!"" etcWhen you finally go home after you've stopped freaking out, you'll go through the entire thing in your mind like you're retroactively critiquing what you've done for errors, or aspects you missed. You can't control this, it's involuntary. You'll relive it every 15 minutes or so, which occurs like one ""remembers"" something suddenly like a smell or whatever, you just ""remember"" that it happened, forget, and then ""remember"" it again. You may focus on certain things what the logo on the attacker's t-shirt was, or the smell of a hotdog stand nearby, but then be totally unable to remember what you were holding in your hands or what you were wearing. Others will describe you as ""zoning out"" when you experience this flashback, and then you may even relive a bit of the shock again, ie numb hands or shaking, the emotional feeling of fear, you'll get jumpy, regular things like a photo on your desk or a poster or your pet will scarefrighten you to look at.For the next week, it'll happen every 10 or so minutes to half an hour. This will impact your life if you work in service or other jobs that require attention. You'll try to forget about it, shake it off and keep going. They say these few days after a trauma is the CRUCIAL time you need to talk about it with a therapist because externalizing these events are the only way to offload this ""debugging"" or ""revision"" you keep doing of the event. You must talk to someone during the first week or it'll imprint on your brain and fuck you up for the long term, and might cement ""triggers"" for these flashbacks, and you do not want that.After this first week the flashbacks begin to subside. During this time there are triggers that might make you remember it again, you'll think ""oh that reminds me of- oh shit"" and remember it all again. For some people it might be the sound of helecopters or bangs that sound like bullets, for some it might be men who only remotely resemble their rapist, or it might be smells or just anything that'd make anyone remember a thing. Sometimes you can't even tell what the hell it is that triggered it and they seem totally unrelated in every way! it's frustrating to not be able to predict what it could be.It'll take maybe a year or so before the time inbetween flashbacks is so long you don't have to worry about it anymore. Therapy can halve this time, so it's very important to use it. Therapy will help you compartmentalize this ""healing"" process, like giving a computer a way to analyze data and sort it properly versus just dumping a bunch of data in it and leaving it to run it's automatic system on it and hope it winds up in the proper folder. The difference is so huge.Anyway, if you're reading this please don't make fun of people who have PTSD even if you think what happened wasn't traumatic. You don't get to decide what does and doesn't fuck someone up. It's not funny for them. They're aware their ""trigger"" might be stupid as well, don't prank them by bringing it up. It doesn't ""get them used to it"". They didn't choose any of this. Thanks",90,FatSputnik,2019-03-22T21:16:52Z,,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.16,0.17,0.17

It's a function built around survival and evolution that can go truly haywire for human beings. It's so much more common than people realize.",6,lunatic_minge,2019-03-22T20:51:45Z,,0.07,0.09,0.55,0.06,0.17,0.06

I mean there are people who seriously get their rocks off by trying to prove they're right by all means necessary on social media, which bleeds over into real life.
