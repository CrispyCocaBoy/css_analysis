Had the Sheriff's Department done it's job just once during the 30 some-odd times they were called to the shooters home and arrested him like, I don't know...the time he pointed a gun at his brothers head and threatened to kill him...he would have lost his guns. Had the FBI actually followed up on the tips called into them, the shooting could've been prevented. Had the school actually have pushed for his arrest and actually secured the buildings, the shooting wouldn't have happened. Had the school resource officer confronted the shooter instead of hiding, some people could've been saved....So instead of addressing the failures at almost every level of government and their failures to protect and keep people safe...some of whom it is their literal job to protect people...failures which prove the government can't be counted on to stop such an obvious threat...the left is demanding something be done about guns?

8aa3jl,"Why toss in that youre a veteran? If true, thank you for your service. Still, how is it relevant to the national discussion? Does you being a veteran mean you get more of a say than someone who didnt serve?Nobody is getting run over at the polls on either side. Both groups are firmly entrenched and vote in bloc. That means the likeliest outcome is continued gridlock. If you want to have an actual conversation, you have to be open to equally-valid, opposite points-of-view. Ill beginYes, we have a violence problem in society. This is not necessarily unique to America, though. In terms of overall deaths, firearm homicides are curiously low when you consider how many there are in circulation. What I think we probably agree on is the disturbing use of violence by unhinged persons. Where I genuinely struggle to identify long-term solutions that specifically address this problem is in balancing the protections afforded for our Rights and freedoms with the possibility of serving society by legally barring unstable persons from not just firearms, but all types of violence that is at their disposal. In my mind, the conversation goes down the road of how do we address individuals prone to violence WHILE protecting the Rights of all Americans, including those we are concerned about because of their history of violence...Any solution that will address this concern needs to also respect the protection of Rights and liberties that we are all endowed with. So, while I agree that it can sound frustrating to hear that your proposed solutions are unacceptable to many in society because they do not adequately consider the aforementioned Rights and liberties, this is actually pretty typical of the idea-forming process. We all have to be willing to throw ideas at the wall without getting insulted when our ideas dont bear fruit because they failed to meet all the necessary criteria. The truth is that if there were an easy solution, we would have already found it. So, if youre willing, Im open to an actual conversation. But this has to be in the spirit of dialogue where we both take into consideration the other persons point-of-view.

8aa3jl,"Ok, I can accept why you inserted the veteran comment. I agree about the Minority Report bit. Im not sure how we address it either. Where I disagree is in the only option comment. Frankly, we have many options. We, in fact, have so many options that we dont even know what all of them are at this point. In any conversation or discussion where we limit ourselves to only one option, we imply that our mind is made up and the discussion is over. Im hoping that isnt the case here. Perhaps Im reading tone into your parting comment, but it feels rather biting for the sort of conversation I was trying to engender. I offered my puzzlement to the problem and was curious about ideas for addressing violence. The idea you did offer doesnt work for meand presumably otherswho are not willing to budge on infringement of any of our Rights or liberties. Still, we should try and discuss the problem from the perspective of identifying a mutually-agreeable solution. Im wondering what sorts of mental health supports we could implement to address violence from the perspective of long-term solutions. My premise is that we didnt create violent individuals overnight, so its unlikely we will solve the problem in short order either. In terms of firearms legislation, as I read through your comments, it sounds like most of the ideas youve presented already exist in one form or another. As such, perhaps the breakdown in our communication is in the enforcement or oversight of those laws and statutes. Without going down the road of enacting new legislation per se, what are your thoughts about creating a better communicationenforcementoversight network to use the existing laws to both keep firearms from prohibited persons AND to respond to those individuals whoin one form or anotherwere clear red flags that should have been picked up along the way, a la Nick Cruz?In my mind, this is the first step that will provide us with the most return.

8aa3jl,"We've both repealed amendments and altered them before.Yes, and we have explicit procedure for doing so. The Courts do not amend the Constitution, nor re-interpret it 'for modern times'. The fact that such belief is tolerated in our judiciary is itself a sign and essence of our collapse as a Constitutional Republic.First off, no we are not. That's why the nation is actively having a discussion about which weapons to allow ownership of and which to restrict. First, the nation isn't really having a discussion. A lot of authoritarians, unconcerned with actually understanding the issue themselves, are following the directions of their Authority figures mostly far-left University intelligentsia, and The State itself to march, backed by the overwhelming blast of absurd propaganda just look at this OP for a perfect example from the monolithic state-approved MSM.Second, the single most universal demand of these authority figures is far-reaching bans of all the most common firearms in the country today, which if done, will render the Second Amendment obviated. Recognizing this fact and what it might mean for the ability of any such laws to actually be put into effect, many are very openly calling for the formal repeal of the Second Amendment itself.Some weapons are already restricted, you do realize that correct? Bombs, chemical weapons, etc. We're just adding new weapons to that list for clear reasons.Yes, and these restrictions are legally structured not as straightforward prohibitions, but as prohibitively high taxes, which, later, they decided to stop accepting any payment of or, in some cases, straight-up 'emergency power' executive order martial law. All Federal Gun Control is structured this way by necessity, in order to pass them through the gaping loophole grant of absolute authority of the 16th Amendment personal income tax. They are still illegal on their face, because the Constitutional proscription outweighs the power. This is just the only way they have any slight whiff of legal plausibility a whiff for if you're physically or perceptionally blind.The amendment actually says ""A well regulated militia, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""You fucked up the actual letter of it and the interpretation. I'm not going to bother arguing this, because it was NEVER ACTUALLY A SINCERE ARGUMENT. The purpose of the 'militia' clause was specifically to contextualize the ""ARMS"" that it is ""THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR"" as weapons of war. Go read US V Miller, the first ever SCOTUS gun control case for the first ever national gun control law, circa 19381934 respectively.Also remember when this was written, arms meant musket and cannon fire. And rifles, pistols both rifles and unrifled, volley-guns, bombs 'torpedoes', blades and maces, and war-ships with many cannons which could destroy cities. And probably other things only remembered in history books. And all of these things, the state of the art weaponry of the time, were owned by private, non-state-agent Citizens at the time - which is precisely what the Second Amendment set out to protect.We've progressed in technology as a society and the founding fathers could not have forseen the weapons we create today when writing this law. No, this is either a disingenuous or extremely ignorant argument. Firearms such as are being discussed are fundamentally similar to arms of the time, and certainly nothing that couldn't have been imagined. This argument might have been a good thing to have, at the dawn of the 20th century, when we were watching the advent of aircraft and aerial bombing. Instead we suffered a terrible silent coup 1913, and have lived under a quiet, insidious tyranny ever since. It's gone too far and it's time for it to fucking stop, and for us to take back our rightful places as CITIZENS OF A FREE STATE.

8aa3jl,"An ar15 might be better for stopping an intruder than a pistol, but a pistol is going to be what you have because a weapon like an ar15 can kill far more people in a short amount of time than a pistolNow you're arguing tactics. There are exactly 2 mass shootings in US history that are worse than one committed with a pistol. There are quite a few committed with AR-15's that fall below that one. It's a trade off, it's called compromiseIt's a concession. Compromise involves both parties getting something they want. Concession is when you surrender something without benefit save not having to surrender more. It's clear where the country is heading on these issues come fall elections. Maybe, but I don't know that where we're headed for is a veto proof majority or a less conservative Supreme Court. Furthermore, even if we get the laws, my point is that they're not necessarily an improvement, much less the end to all our woes that they are advertised to be. We as a society accept some arms legitimate capabilities are overshadowed by their destructive capabilities so we ban them. The definition of ""assault weapon"" has nothing to do with it's capabilities.

We all know people affected by it.Last month we were watching the March for Our Lives and I grabbed my guitar and this song came out. This isn't a political song. I don't know what the solution is to fix all this school violence, but I know something needs to change. I've been inspired by the students of MSD who have decided to take action into their own hands and make a difference. So this song is for them as my way of saying thank you and to keep fighting.I hope when my kids 7 2 go to Douglas, they won't have to worry the way kids do right now. And that parents won't worry like they do now. The problem will never go away but we can do better.This song is really for anyone who sees something that needs change. YOU CAN be the voice or the person to make it so. Stand up, fight for what you believe and never give up.Thank you to anyone who is trying to make a positive difference in people's lives. This world needs as much positivity as it can get.Thank you for taking the time to listen to this song. I hope you enjoy it.Jessehttpswww.youtube.comwatch?v7g11qzhp1M",jesseyoungmusic,2018-05-05T14:10:56Z,Reddit,0.14,0.11,0.13,0.20,0.14,0.09,0.09,0.11
1137rx6,"EDIT Thanks all for dropping in your questions. That's all the time we have for today's AMA, but we will be on the lookout for any big, lingering questions. Please continue to follow our coverage and support our journalism. We couldn't do this work without your support.PROOF httpsi.redd.it1f3wjeznm8ia1.jpgIn the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High massacre in 2018, we reported for the first time how many children had endured a shooting at a K-12 school since 1999, and the final tally was far higher than what we had expected more than 187,000.Now, just five years later, and despite a pandemic that closed many campuses for nearly a year, the number has exploded, climbing past 331,000.We know that because weve continued to maintain a unique database that tracks the total number of children exposed to gun violence at school, as well as other vital details, including the number of people killed and injured, the age, sex, race and gender of the shooters, the types and sources of their weapons, the demographic makeup of the schools, the presence of armed security guards, the random, targeted or accidental nature of the shootings.Steven is the database editor for the investigations unit at The Washington Post.

1137rx6,"From John Woodrow CoxWe do know that shooters sometimes study previous shooters and aspire to be as famous or, in some cases, kill more people. Journalists have come a long way on this issue since Columbine, when many media outlets glamourized the shooters in an irresponsible way. We still feel an obligation to tell people who the shooters are and what motivated the violence. Thats fundamental to the job. But were also very careful not to repeat the shooters names or publicize their images unnecessarily. And I think its made a real difference. Whereas most people could name the Columbine shooters, I doubt many could name the Uvalde or Oxford of Michigan State shooters.

Children of color, however, are far more likely to experience campus gun violence more than twice as much for Hispanic students and over three times as much for Black students. Shootings at those schools are typically targeted one student shooting one or two others. Fewer casualties almost always result in less media coverage. Based on all my years reporting on this subject, I also believe that shootings in black and brown neighborhoods tend to get less coverage, in general.

A deranged man held himself up in a Bell Tower in Austin Texas, and started opening fire on those below. In total he killed 17 people and injured 30. To this day it remains one of the deadliest mass shootings. Upon his autopsy, a small tumor was found in the brain of the shooter.There was the Cleveland Elementary School Shooting of 1979 in San Diego. 2 people were killed and 9 were injured. Interestingly enough this was one of the few mass shootings committed by a girl. It was a 16 year old girl who lived across the street from the school. The 1991 Luby's Cafe Shooting in Killeen Texas. A man drove his car through the wall of a Luby's Restaurant in Texas. While everyone was in a daze from that, he started opening fire with a handgun. In total he killed 23 people, and wounded 27 others, in what was the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S until the Virginia Tech Shooting in 2008.The San Ysidro McDonald's Massacre of 1984. Prior to Luby's, this was the deadliest mass shooting, with 21 killed and 18 wounded. There were also several mass murders involving weapons other than guns. The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, the largest domestic terrorist attack in U.S history. A man filled a truck with homemade explosives, and detonated it next to the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. 164 people were killed, and another 680 were injured. The 1993 World Trade Center Bombing in NYC. A radical Islamic group tried to blow up the Twin Towers prior to the 911 attacks. 6 people were killed, and 1,000 injured. The 1990 Happyland Nightclub Fire in NYC. A man got into a fight with his girlfriend at a nightclub, resulting in him being thrown out. In response he purchased a few dollars worth of gasoline, and set the building on fire. In total 87 innocent people died, and 6 were injured. This attack killed 45 more people than the deadliest mass shooting in U.S history. The 1927 Bath School Bombing. A disgruntled man blew up a school with dynamite.

1137rx6,"Out of all gun violence, the vast majority every year - roughly 23 - are suicides. That leaves around 12k homicides. That includes police involved shootings, by the way. Its not even close to the top 10 causes of death in the US - even if you include suicides. Bloomberg the former mayor and other billionaires throw tens of millions of dollars to fund gun control groups. His spending alone utterly dwarfs the NRAs spending, and he is on record stating if they start to catch up hell just dump more at it to outspend them. As a billionaire, he has the ability to do this, and at least hes putting his money where his mouth is. But make no mistake - the vast majority of gun control efforts are every bit profiteering as much as they accuse gun manufacturers of doing. Common sense legislations with holes so big John Madden could fill an hours long podcast with commentary on. Blatantly unconstitutional measures that fall afoul of multiple amendments, let alone the 2nd, that they KNOW will get struck down in court - and theyll leave the people involved hung out to dry, like when they lost the Sandy Hook suit. All of this is spurred on by media like the OP here, who stir, stir, stir the fear pot. Dont get me wrong - I do have sympathy for people who have had to live through events like this. I was stationed at Fort Hood in 2009. That one happened right across the parking lot from my companys building, and I had friends in there who barely escaped. There is a lot of raw emotion surrounding gun violence. But we cannot make progress on addressing root causes if we are constantly whipped into a hyperbolic frenzy about the gun itself. There are over 600 million guns in the US, and thats just the ones we can track. Pandoras box was opened and theres no going back from it. We need to find ways to work around it and live with them and move forward together, and those solutions do not include getting rid of all the guns. Thats an idealistic pipe dream. Maybe if we didnt hold guns up on this pedestal of being some super powered mythical instant win command respect or fear thing, it wouldnt be the first thing disturbed and deranged people turn to when they lash out. Maybe if we looked at why they felt disenfranchised in the first place and took the hard steps to assess and address those issues commonly poverty economic opportunity, no social safety net, etc we would make more progress. Roughly 6,000 veterans per year commit suicide, with half a little over 3,000 choosing a firearm. Roughly 500 people a year are killed with an assault weaponAR15-style rifle. So by simply addressing veteran issues youd do more to save lives than an assault weapon ban. Thats not a sexy fundraising issue though. Bloomberg isnt shelling out tens of millions and making big public statements about funding veteran support programs or job retraining though he has enough philanthropic efforts Im sure hes got some token thing going around that. Gonna cut myself off here because this is getting long but yeah. Its frustrating to see posts like this AMA that are designed to just rile people up enough to pass some other BS nonsensical gun control legislation that wont budge the needle on violent deaths and will be struck down in a few years anyway.",NorCalAthlete,2023-02-16T02:03:41Z,Reddit,0.11,0.11,0.13,0.15,0.11,0.13,0.13,0.13
1137rx6,"Having to chop this into 2 parts as I hit Reddits comment limit, sorry -Posting this as a separate comment for further discussion I feel like many times we never get much further than shooting down each others arguments, so Im going to attempt to drive past that with some proposals of gun control measures I think actually might do some good.1. No more law enforcement exemptions. Equal footing across the board. Quit the class warfare. Of law enforcement gets full auto SBRs, so should the average person. Body armor? You betcha. Armored vehicles? Sure, why not. Either we all have access or nobody does. 2. Secure background checks available to all, instantly. It doesnt have to retain your info, but we live in a day and age where we can pull up medical and criminal records on our phones on the fly - I see no reason we cant have a system where NICS can be available to everyone, not just FFLs, so that even a private party transfer can have someone input their info and it simply spits out a green light red light yes theyre good to go or no theyre a prohibited person. Doesnt need to track whether or not they already own a gun, doesnt need to retain information that they just made a purchase, just at this time this person is good to go. THAT is a universal background check that I think everyone could get on board with, vs the current only-available-to-FFLs system. 3. Reimplement gun safety training in schools. If we can do sex ed, drugs, etc, under the guise of theyre going to encounter it sooner or later, they should be prepared to understand and know the consequences, I see no reason not to include basic firearm safety with this. They dont have to shoot live ammo or blanks or actually get any range time, but SHOULD understand how to safely check to see if a gun is loaded and unload it. They should understand to keep it pointed in a safe direction, keep their finger off the trigger at all times, and assume every gun they encounter is loaded until proven otherwise. Its not difficult. 4. Take suppressors off the NFA list. Its only courteous. Or at least allow threaded barrels and such so that they may be rented or freely available for use at practice ranges. Contrary to Hollywood belief suppressed gunshots are still LOUD and recognizable as gunshots. It just lessens the hearing damage and noise pollution from outdoor ranges. 5. If youre going to insist on licensing, then Im going to insist on tiered licensing and compromise speaking to the general you, here, not necessarily the person Im replying to. So for example at tier 1, you have to pass a basic safety test, and then can buy anything up to say, a 9mm semi-auto, a 20ga shotgun semi or otherwise, or .22 rifle any kind. Renew every 10 years. Tier 2 might be something like Tier 1 you can go up to a .44 mag pistol, .30-06 rifle, 12ga shotgun, plus mail order ammo to your house in bulk, etc. Renew every 5 years. Tier 3 is Tier 2 CCW, NFA items ie full auto, SBRs, suppressors, etc. Renew every 2 years.",NorCalAthlete,2023-02-16T08:24:22Z,Reddit,0.13,0.14,0.13,0.15,0.08,0.11,0.14,0.13
1137rx6,"6. Waiting periods. 7 days so as to coincide with consistent days off work schedule weekend, only apply to your first gun the aforementioned NICS flag is easy to make where it simply is a Boolean truefalse for already a gun owner status, and exemptions for urgency such as a restraining order stalker, immediate threats, etc. It makes no sense that under current versions of so-called cooling off waiting periods I can literally walk into a gun store with a gun on my hip and still have to wait another 10 days for the next gun. 7. Quit the shenanigans with treating gun ranges the same way Texasred states do abortion clinics. Id rather have people who can aim and hit their target over people who spray and hit bystanders. Most homicides are targeted beef. Let it end with that and not catch 6 other people 100 yards away down the block if someone is pissed off enough to abuse it. Im not saying gun ranges should be as plentiful as Starbucks, but from a safe use perspective, you shouldnt have to drive 2 hours away to get some practice in, either. Not everyone has that option. No random requirements that seem reasonable but magically preclude a gun range from operating. 8. Mandatory sunset clauses. If new gun control laws cannot be proven to have had the measurable impact on gun safety they were purported to in order to pass, they get rolled back. Quit piling on when you know its not going to do anything. 9. Ease up on the plea bargains. Gun charges for people who have actually used them to commit crimes from murder to robbery are often the first thing dropped in sentencing. Fuck that. If youre going to pound the gun control drum for assault weapons and everything, dont then turn around and pardon httpswww.turnto23.comnewscrimebakersfield-family-asks-for-justice-after-gov-newsom-pardons-killer while he was already on the ground wounded from the first shot to his back. They shouldnt be bargaining chips. And Im not talking about oh he got a DUI and happened to have a gun in the car, by all means negotiate on dumb stuff like that where nobody was hurt. But if someone literally killed another person with a gun during a robbery or something...no plea bargain. None. Maaaaaaaybe if theyre giving up a bigger fish, but thats it. In a similar vein - lying on a background check form 4473 is currently punishable by up to 10 years in jail and a 250,000 fine. Out of hundreds of thousands who have failed their background check, fewer than a couple dozen have actually been charged for it. Thats some really, really low hanging fruit not being enforced. So the fact that we have people clamoring for more laws while ignoring criminals handing themselves to law enforcement on a silver platter just doesnt make sense to me. 10. Capping this list at 10 for now its long enough as it is. Ive probably managed to upset both some pro-gun people and anti-gun people with this list. Thats fine. Thats how you know its actually a compromise. So to finish the list taxes. Gun control has become well, maybe always was a class warfare issue. If youre wealthy enough, no matter what state you live in, you can get any type of firearm you want. Yes, even in California. And yes, even tanks! Gun control advocates have proposed severely increased taxes and fees on guns, ammunition, and gun parts, ignoring that theyve already been sharply increased several times in the past. If you think 20 is too much for a voter ID, and impedes the right to vote, then you should also be upset at things like a 200 tax stamp to get a suppressor for a firearm - its not even the actual firearm, just a part! When the NFA was passed, if adjusted for inflation it would be like being asked to pay 3500 for a gun part. That puts it squarely out of reach of most lower and even middle class people. Guns are an extension of the right to self defense and bodily autonomy, among other things. Guns are not solely for the wealthy, or for Hollywood.

1137rx6,"Thanks for the latest. I dont know how much of the recent shift in proportions can be attributed to normal issues vs pandemic issues though. On average, over the last few decades, it has held relatively steady at rounding for numbers sake something like30k deaths, out of which 20k are suicides8k are gang related1k are police involved Leaving 1k unjustified including mass shootings and the like. The numbers HAVE spiked in the last few years. The pandemic has introduced new stressors, there have been more instances of police brutality sparking protests, under the cover of which bad actors have preyed on other innocents, leading to further loss of life. The economy has been all over the place, and loss of job is a pretty common factor in suicide. And yet. From your most recent figures the majority of gun violence deaths are STILL suicide. Homicides, even factoring in gang related and, by the way, the Guardian link on locality bears reposting still remain relatively low. 25k 330,000k. Can we do better? Absolutely. I simply disagree about how we might go about that, and believe that if we campaigned for, funded, and preached about things that would actually move the needle instead of just rah rah ban guns, we would have made more significant progress by now. Gun control, imo, is a losing cause, and always has been. I would wager that a significant enough chunk of single issue voters would vote Democrat, if not for gun control, that Democrats would win in an overwhelming landslide in any state or election that wasnt staunchly a Republican stronghold. And the way theyve been imploding lately, I would say even those areas might be winnable....if not for gun control. Gun owners are quite possibly THE most diverse voting demographic in the US.

1137rx6,"Australia's gun violence was already on a decline before the ban though, and the ban itself only garnered something like a 10 compliance rate. So I don't think that's a particularly good example template to uphold, despite how often it gets brought up. Like, gun violence in general was already statistically insignificant there, and a single mass shooting was a blip. As for semi-auto handguns being overlooked in legislation - they're not overlooked, it's a very intentional part of a disinformation campaign on behalf of gun control groups. re rifles assault weapons that are typically the focus of new gun control lawsThe term ""assault weapon"" became widely used starting the late 1980s.

To address your other points, semi-auto handguns are actually typically MORE expensive than revolvers, and concealability is a wash - they're both easily concealable and roughly the same size depending on model and there are so many models of each it's a pointless generalization some revolvers are indeed too massive to conveniently conceal, and some semi-autos are the same. In the US, unfortunately we have several examples of mass shooters using non-semi-automatic clunky term for bolt action or single shot, but hammers the point home better I think guns. Primary among them being the Austin clock tower shooter. Additionally, I might point out that California's big thing for gun control is the so-called ""SAFE"" roster and microstamping laws, with the theory being a firing pin will leave a readily-identifiable mark on shell casings left at a crime scene that law enforcement can trace back to the gun owner. Ease of removing said markings aside, this microstamping is completely nullified by simply carrying a revolver, which doesn't automatically eject shell casings as you shoot. Lastly, to address the thought of ""nullifying the idea of carrying a firearm to feel safe"" - carrying a firearm is a whole separate issue from a semi-automatic ban. That being said, semi-automatics tend to be the weapon of choice, so perhaps there's at least more of a tenuous link between those than your other points.

He said a gun is powerful and when people lose respect for what it can truly do, there are problem.

For some reason, thats when we consider it to have all began its not, its just the first publicized occurrence.That was in 1999, halfway through the Assault Weapons Ban, which had the effect of limiting access to firearms like the AR-15. So, it is worth noting that the era of school shooting begins during the strictest period of firearms law in the United States.In 2004, the Assault Weapons Ban lapsed to much wailing and gnashing of teeth or applause and celebration depending on political leaning.Nothing happens.No, seriously. Nothing happens. The FBI collects and tracks crime data in the Uniform Crime Report. Over the years, you will see a trend beginning in the late 1980s of violence beginning to decrease that continues through until today. The AWB came and went, and there is nary a bump in the trend line to signal its existence. Violence, of any type, neither improved nor worsened relative to a slow decay experienced by almost the entire developed world.California, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, and several other states and individual cities enact legislation to control the type and use of firearms within their jurisdictions in response to the lapse of the Assault Weapons Bans or the ebb and flow of political tides.Nothing happens.In several states, Constitutional Carry passes, enabling citizens without criminal records to bear arms in public without individual licensure.Nothing happens.Concealed Carry Reciprocity passes, forming a network of states that each recognize each others license, allowing those with out-of-state licenses to bear arms in public.Nothing happens.Bump stocks and binary triggers appear, each purporting to increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic firearms.Nothing happens.An executive order is released to ban bump stocks under the assumption that they increase lethality.Nothing happens.The problems we have today absolutely were problems 20 or 30 years ago, and we havent been ignoring them, either. Weve simply been chasing ineffective solutions.Edit I should also mention that several major universities now allow their students to bear arms on campus, a change that was met with the sound of thundering crickets.",GreatBlueNarwhal,2019-02-14T20:09:32Z,Reddit,0.10,0.11,0.11,0.19,0.13,0.13,0.10,0.12

13m3jt7,"I would argue its not pedantic when politicians target assault weapons as the objects to be banned. An assault weapon does not exist. Its a general term that has no real meaning. An assault weapon can mean a lot of things. I can assault you with a knife, a chair, a stick, the lists goes on. Does that make those things an assault weapon. If were referring to just firearms then does it mean rifles? Semi-automatic rifles? Bolt-action? Handguns? Most mass shootings are actually committed with handguns, and most handguns are semi-automatic, yet you dont really see that being talked about in bans. Machine guns or fully automatic firearms have long been banned and require intensive special licenses to own now. Politicians weaponize which guns looks most scary and while AR-15s have been used in some of the deadliest shootings we have had, even those have lots of different types. I dont say this to just illustrate how the left is stupid, just that if were going to enact effective legislation then maybe its time everyone who is so passionate about this do about 15 minutes of actual research and learn the differences so we can know what exactly needs to be banned.The vaccine example another commenter posted I think is a really good analogy.

1f9896a,"Not a Teacher. Hope to be one in a few years. I went to a school that had a shooting in the 90s. Funny thing is I never heard a thing about gun control in that school. I am sure some of the staff had opinions. I never felt unsafe in that school. I knew students that were there when the shooting happened and they weren't afraid for their safety. I also had a 2nd cousin that was a student at Columbine. I will point out a few things about a nation wide strike idea. In my state teachers are not allowed to be in a union therefore no job protection for walking out. Public School teachers are considered state employees and very few state employees in my state have the ability to form a union for collective bargaining. I think it is mostly Firefighters that can. Secondly all that is needed to defend the 2nd Amendment is 17 states. You need 34 to pass an amendment. I will point out I know of at least 13 states including Georgia will vote to keep the 2nd Amendment.Instead of talking gun control lets talk about dealing with the root causes of these shootings. In most cases including the one at my school the shooter was being bullied. We need more mental health counseling in the country period. We need smaller classroom sizes. We absolutely need smaller schools. My home county has 6 out of 12 non charter or private high schools that are 1500 students. When I was in high school we didn't have 9th grade on campus simply because the school building could not hold 3000 students. What people aren't talking about is the schools are too big that it is hard to police the root causes of these events. Finally we need to address school funding. This includes teacher pay.

I am angry that women are getting attacked on every front....and they still voted for it. I told my daughter that she could be anything she wanted to be. I lied to her. They keep a boot on our neck because they think we are cattle. I see it now and I did not see it when I was younger because I was brainwashed to believe that a man was needed for a good life. I think more women need to be angry and aware of what we are very close to losing. We are sick of men raping killing us and them blaming us. I think that has a lot to do with it. The younger girls are more aware than we give them credit for. We have made the decision to pull our kid out of public school. They are no longer safe. Its not the teachers indoctrinating kids. If we lived in a blue state we could fight these changes but in Arkansas.... It feels gross. He will get a better education at home with an online accredited school and it will pay for extracurricular activities. Im struggling with doing what is best and safest for him as a mother and being stubborn and pissed that it is even an option. It is a privilege that we can have a parent at home.

I'm trying to be as concise as possible, but there's a lot that went on.TLDR Listen to people when they tell you to keep your head down and your mouth shut.So, to give a little bit of context for those outside the US. After the Parkland shooting where 17 students died, Parkland students planned a national protest for students to walk out of school at 10 a.m. If I remember correctly, they were also going to have moment of silence for 17 minutes, one minute for every student who died.When I became aware of the protests, I talked to my 8th graders about it. We discussed why it was happening, what it was about, and what to think about if they decided to participate. I gave students a chance to discuss if they agreed or disagreed with the protests and the reasons it was happening. Overall, it was a very civil discussion, and we moved on.As it became closer to the protests, our school sent out a series of emails. One was from some higher up, saying students shouldn't protest. Another said that only high schoolers were allowed to protest. The ACLU sector of my state even sent out letters to all of the Superintendents reminding them that students have the constitutional right to protest. All of this culminated in a meeting with our Principal the day of, during which the 8th grade teachers were told that it was our job to stand in front of the doors and prevent students from walking out.This is when I'd had enough.During the meeting I told my Principal, I'm sorry, but I can't do this. She said that's fine, I'll write you up for insubordination. I said I understand, and that's a conversation that we can have later, but I can't do this. She told me there would be no conversation, I would be written up. I told her okay.I spent a long time considering if I was really willing to do this. If it was a fight I really wanted to have. I called my husband and talked to him about it. We talked about if it was worth the risk of getting fired. I talked to another teacher who I knew was written up and discussed what it meant for my license or my career at the school.In the end I decided not to stand by the door. I could not, in good conscience, tell my students that I support their right to protest, and then participate in something that was getting in the way of them doing that. It was hypocritical and I would have no part in it. In addition to that, I was also 7 months pregnant and I did not want to put myself in a situation where I could potentially get hurt.The time came and went. I chose to stand in the cafeteria that was designated as a ""safe"" place for the students who left class to protest. I wanted to show them whatever support I could, and the day moved on.A few days later my Principal calls me into the office and we have our ""discussion."" The conversation can be summed up in her statement of ""If you can't do what you're told, I don't think this is the profession for you."" She seemed to take it as a personal offense to her that I wouldn't do what she asked. I tried my best to be respectful, to make it clear that it wasn't her I had a problem with, and that I understood she was doing what was asked of her by the superintendent, but none of that mattered.So, at the end of the school year, I go on my maternity leave. The last day of school for teachers was the 25th and I asked my principal if I could come unofficially since I was still on leave just to say hello to everyone before summer break and introduce everyone to the baby. She says that's fine. I go. I talked to everyone. I talk to my principal, tell everyone that I hope they have a good summer and I'll see them next year.When I come home, I get a letter in the mail saying that my contract wasn't renewed.Some days, I still don't know if I made the right choice. I now have a daughter who has no insurance as of yesterday. I've been unable to find a new job. And we bought a house right before I got the letter. If I could have just done what I was told I wouldn't be in this situation, but I just hate that there's is so much backstabbing in some administrations.I understand that what I did was insubordination. I understand that there are consequences, but I also feel like the least my principal could have done was tell me that my contract wasn't going to be renewed to give me the chance of finding a new job. There was no need to wait until the very last day of school, and there was no reason she couldn't tell me to my face. And knowing that she's a person who gossips and can't keep a secret, I'm also upset that no one who knew thought to trust me with the secret and tell me my job was gone.I see a lot of new teachers asking for advice, and a lot of people say to wait until you have tenure to speak up.

u8oopt,"If youre someone who lived on the planet of Earth during 2018, youve probably heard of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland Florida. If you were a student, teacher, or parent of a student in America during this time, youve probably felt that gut wrenching devastation and fear that came with watching something like that shooting go down. Parkland shook America. If you were a teacher during this time, the point of this post is to get your feelings on the matter, but specifically, how did you go aboutfeel about the student orchestrated protests held at schools, during school days and hours, all across America whether they were allowed by the school or not? Like for example, did you support these protests and uproars? Did you disapprove? And etc. I was in 7th grade when parkland happened and I havent been the same since. That very February, I ended up getting suspended along with two other students because we left our school with intentions to properly protest gun violence in schools. I remember there being a divide in opinions between the teachers at my school.

u8oopt,"Honestly? ""Well that sucks, but if Sandy Hook didn't change anything this won't either"". Parkland led to March For Our Lives, but that ultimately didn't change much of anything. As bad as it sounds, after growing up through Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Parkland, and numerous other school shootings throughout the years, I've grown apathetic to them. They should never happen, but we live in a country where the same story happens again, and again, and again, while the general consensus seems to be ""A few dead kids every now and then is worth it if I can continue to own my murder toy and fetishize about protecting myself from the government or shooting hypothetical home invaders"".I was teaching abroad in Korea at the time of Parkland and was actually hanging out with someone from Florida who went to Parkland's rival school when we first heard the news, I was just glad to be living and teaching in a place where something like a school shooter drill was incomprehensible and not needed.

8lobs9,"So I'm a first year teacher in a school that is considerably larger than the one I went to and security is taken very seriously. Especially after a recent scare in a neighboring district kids called 911 saying there was a shooter as a ""prank"" admins decided we should have a realistic shooter drill to see what problems there were with protocol and protecting students. The building was cleared of students before the drill started so that was at least one positive. We had no real warning, after have the gist of the drill being explained basically, you won't actually be shot and you'll know when it starts we were told to go about our day as usual. I went back to my room and waited. There was no announcement, just shots. I locked my door and went to where my students would be and just listened. The worst part was hearing the actors screaming ""he's killing me, help me"" and knowing that I couldn't do a damn thing because I had to protect the ""students"" in my room already. I had to let this girl die to save my students. It must be a special kind of hell for the teachers and students that survived parkland, Sandy Hook and all the other places that shootings have happened.

So yesterday he got in trouble and an argument with the teacher he has the period before me. He was clearly really mad so I just gave him space to cool off. During my class, I caught him off task on the laptops using a program we have that allows teachers to see students screens. When I started looking, I saw that he was looking up all of his teachers personal information including cell phone numbers, home addresses, and personal email accounts. He was making a PowerPoint, one slide dedicated to each teacher and all their information. This was really creepy to me especially because he was already so angry that I reported it to my admin. Whelp, found out today he was expelled from our school, that this was the last straw. I didnt realize me reporting that information would get him expelled, and now Im worried that he may come back for revenge. I teach at a school in Florida so the Parkland shooting is something always in our minds. The shooter from Parkland had just been expelled and then came back and did what he did...... what if this student does that? Would I be his target because I got him kicked out?? Would I be the reason this student came back and attacked innocent studentsteachers? I hate that this is the way teachers have to think now.

7zpqiy,"Think about the Civil Rights movement and how things built up over time. Black men in the South were getting lynched all the time. Why was Emmett Till different? Why were the Freedom Summer murders? Why do we remember the things we remember. Note I'm not saying this is the same issue because I know someone will misread this if this post gets any traction. The American Civil Rights movement is just a really good example of this series of starts and stops that seemed to bubble over with change, when really the seeds had been heavily sewn for several decades of relatively little movement on the issues at hand and even plenty of regressions. I think that's where we are now with a lot of things, including this. Everything in history that changes anything becomes the tip of the iceberg. We don't see the whole thing usually unless you study it in depth, of course. We see the big moments. And those moments are picked by the collective psyche of mankind in some weird way, by fate sometimes, and they are the moments that generate change. I'm not sure Parkland will become the tip of the iceberg. It may be part of it, but it may take more to get to the truly defining and culminating moment. It's WAY too early to tell. But it feels different, you're right. Why? Because change doesn't happen over night. And it doesn't happen because some politician declares it. Change comes from the people. Right now, these students are participating in activism that appears to be powerful, gaining some traction, etc, and hopefully that continues.

My para and I are BOTH firm with rules, but some of the high schoolers really dislike my para basically have issues with women giving them directions. One student in particular had a rough year all around with everyone, but particularly her, and eventually ranted about putting a bullet in her brainthis was 3ish days after Parkland. The cops should have been called so much earlier, but that was the last straw, I talked to the SRO, got the ball rolling, student was arrested for terroristic threats, and spent two-ish weeks in jail before being bailed out. I know some staff thought my para and I were over-reacting, and some people were being jerks and passive aggressive about how they werent scared blah blah blah, but Ive stuck by my para and been supportive because no, being EBD doesnt mean you can scream about shooting people in the head with no consequences. Dude is 17.Anyways, kid made bail, is out, but no court date to determine anything, and he was actually eager to come back to school. Para not ok with that, says she will quit if he comes back and she is a fabulous para, I love her understandably, so I worked with ppl and plead our case, and student was put on home-ish bound, in theory to allow him to catch up and focus on his work without students asking him what went on, etc. but there is no court order that says he cant come to school.so then we came to end of course testing. Para was like wait, what, he has to come in to test? Yes, he does, do you want to take those days off, I will make sure there is no contact, but I can tell she is still upset and thinks it is unfair.Then today I found out that he is asking if he can participate in some end of the year activities, and he will most likely be coming back next year. Para is livid, saying she still has the ability to take out an order of protection against him and will quit if he comes back to school and will testify in court as to that effect. I dont know what to do.

We have mentally ill students who HAVE actually brought weapons including guns to school, and after serving time, have returned to school.

8bey95,"Warning Really, really long story but even shortened there is a lot to explain. I never thought I would be asking for help on something like this but I need advice on how to frame my time at my last school as I begin to job search again. I took a job this year at an urban middle school after two years go being a successful elementary school teacher. To put it bluntly, it was the worst mistake of my progressional life. Besides being out of my element with this new location, grade level and subject matter am certified, never taught, I shared a classroom with two different teachers for almost six months with no real divider as we waited to move into a new building, had no projector or smart board in a technology heavy 11 school, had no support for the fifth of my grade who spoke little to english or was pushed-in from the self-contained class as that was only for tested subjects and was teaching a grade level that had such a high amount of students with behavior issues that it required a meeting in which my principal asked the parents to talk to their kids because after over 800 write-ups in five months they didn't know what to do anymore.I struggled in a way I never struggled before. I did everything you could imagine to make my lessons the best they could be and manage the behaviors in my classroom. I worked a minimum of 70 hours a week. I also observed other teachers, asked for help often and tried every strategy I could but because of these issues that I now admit were out of control and also kept changing every time I felt I had a handle on things a new policy or school setup changed, my classes became more and more out of control.In response, I was a burnt out mess. I was having multiple nervous breakdowns a week, had a terrible stress-induced crohns's flare up that lasted over a month and would burst into tears multiple times a week not in front of students but co-workers and administrators which I think only happened twice before that and it was only to teachers I was friends with. I prayed that I would someone leave this job.I ended up getting my wish in the worst way possible.One day in class the students were working on a choice board project. This was one of rougher classes with a lot of challenging students including one who was determined to disrupt the class in whatever way he could. The student who I will called Zee would yell, run around my class, play on his computer with the sound all the way on and tell other students to stop working because my class was stupid and didn't matter. I did every possible consequence in my power but his behavior continued to worsen.I was helping a student with something when I overhead another student say the Zee was talking about bombings and how a muslim student in my class could help him. I didn't hear a lot but I did say I was going to follow up and write-up the behavior. I wrote up the fact that racist comments were made that next morning but what Zee said about bombings didn't really hit me until I hit send on my write-up. I barely heard how Zee was talking about bombing school but this was literally a few days after the Parkland shooting occurred. On one hand, Zee said crazy stuff all the time although nothing about weapons and bombs but it always was to just get a reaction. He was disruptive but ultimately he was a 12 year-old boy who wanted attention. But I kept thinking what if it was something this time. I would never forgive myself if I said nothing and I put my students' lives in danger. So when my supervisor popped his head in my class I asked to talk to him and explain what I thought I heard in class. I was expecting him to thank me and find the student to talk to him. We never talked about what happened in Parkland and how to respond to a situation like this. And teaching only elementary, this never was an issue before.Instead, he got very angry at me and asked why I didn't tell him this sooner. Taken aback I said how I told him as soon as I remembered and also with Zee he tended to say intense and disruptive things all the time and you had to take things with him with a grain of salt. But when I realized the next day the what what he said could mean, I got him right away.My supervisor tried to find Zee but he wasn't in school that day so a full investigation was done to see if the claims were real or not. Everyone was involved and they even his house was searched. Nothing was found, Zee was just talking crap to look cool and annoy the muslim student who he was fighting with that week.Despite it all being okay, my principal finds me during lunch and tells me that because of what happened I should talk to my union rep and see them after school. I am in shock and terrified because this is the last thing I expected to happen. I find of the reps and immediately begin crying My amazing rep, once she heard the whole story, first told me my work conditions were terrible and should have talked to her sooner. And in response to the incident, she assured me that I wouldn't get fired but would probably get a write up in my personnel file and reprimanded. The timing wasn't good but I didn't do it on purpose and I was as timely as I could possibly be considering I forgot about the main comment.One part was right. It was put in my personnel file. But I was told I made a gross misjudgment because I should have hit the red button and asked for a supervisor right away. But because of my classes being as chaotic as they were I didn't and put hundreds of lives in danger. Because of that I was fired but I had the option to resign in order to control my narrative. If allowed myself to be fired I would have to work 60 more days but if i resigned I would stop working as soon as I sent the letter. My rep was surprised and shocked at how that went but explained that treatment like this was not a new thing. I asked her what to do and she said I should resign. After the way I was treated I do not owe them any more work, and knowing me I could still get a job in childcare to support myself. So I resigned but surprisingly enough I left on really good terms with my principal and administration? They all wished me luck in finding a better matched school and my supervisor offered to write me a reference letter explaining the goods things they can say if they are asked and that I left the school on good terms.I got a job as a nanny and was planning on applying later in the year but found out there is a big teacher job fair coming up. There will be 29 districts including first district I ever worked at and this district is nice enough to not need job fairs to recruit so I'm super excited. I was loved at this district but it being a leave replacement it was only temporary and loved working there. I really want to impress them again and return and in normal circumstances, I probably would have. But here are my worries and the questions I need answers to.1. How the heck do I explain why I left? I'm not going to mention the incident unless they see my file and ask but my resume still says I left mid-year and I know how bad that looks. On one hand, I don't want to look like a complainer talking about how horrible my last school was. But on the other hand, I want people to understand that my situation was not typical. If I left, it was for a damn good reason so just because I didn't want to work to fix things. So if I am asked what happened, what do I say? Can I convey how terrible the school was without actually saying how terrible the school was?2. Do people actually check your personnel file? I was told it barely happens but it must happen sometimes. And it's going to say a little bit about the incident. So is there a way to explain that?Thank you in advance to all help!",throwawayacct201,2018-04-11T06:18:37Z,Reddit,0.13,0.12,0.12,0.13,0.12,0.13,0.12,0.13

x0lisn,"So I'm confused about so much more than what is said in this article. A grand jury was created to investigate the Parkland High School shooting. Okay fine. It's not inconceivable that someone would want to know whether there was a failure of administration that led to the shooting and whether someone could be charged. But it is notable that the decision to create the grand jury would have been made by a republican, and the school administration is mostly democratic.The grand jury apparently doesn't pursue any criminal charges, but releases a report on its findings. That's weird because that's not what grand juries do. In any case the report is confidential because all documents related to grand juries are confidential. This report finds that there was negligence and incompetence among School Board Administration in Broward county. But didn't recommend charges. Again very weird. This report was released in April of 2021. No actions were taken. But in August of 2022, 60 days before an election, the governor unseals a report and dismisses four members of the school board named as having been incompetent. Importantly he does this while a jury is actually deliberating on the fate of the shooter.He does nominally have the power to dismiss public officials who have committed a gross breach of Duty, but the timing is bizarre and just not referenced in the article.

x0lisn,"Basically the Constitution says each state must have at least one member in the House of Representatives and that if a state has more than one district, they must be of roughly equal population. Currently the House is also locked to 435 members which causes a lot of issues with properly representing how many members a large state gets and states get to draw their own districts. Each state does it differently with some having an independent commission doing it to lessen gerrymandering while others are made by the state legislature. There are also some rules that must be followed to make sure districts arent being drawn to exclude minorities. Like lets say one area is a majority African American and the population is big enough to warrant its own district, the lines cant be drawn in a way to break it up and split that population up into say four districts, because that would be discrimination. The biggest issue right now is the amount of gerrymandering and the fact that some legislatures have found out that there arent really consequences for drawing unconstitutional districts. The court system is supposed to send the map back if it has issues, but nothing is stopping the legislature from sending the same map back with some slight changes that dont address the issue. Eventually the election comes and a map has to be used, and guess what the only one available is.Edit 435 instead of 385 members in the House.",Rbespinosa13,2022-08-29T13:20:25Z,Reddit,0.13,0.12,0.10,0.17,0.11,0.12,0.12,0.12

According to the theory, The millennials are the next 'greatest generation' who overcome great adversity and lead the world into a new recovery. The reason Bannon advocated for Trump to go balls to the wall on everything is because he was trying to start that new adversity that your generation will overcome.

7xpqwo,"True. However, studies show that it takes one or two generations for a fundamental cultural shift. Start out in schools with therapists directly working with kids - help the bullied kid to not internalize the abuse they're receiving so that it doesn't affect their self image help the bully work through whatever it is that is driving them to lash out at those around them. Work with the kid who is posting pictures of dead animals to their instagram. Not all kids will accept therapy since their parents will be against it, but once those kids who did accept the help that therapy can give grow up, we'll have a much larger portion of well balanced adults. People who didn't receive therapy when they were a child might look at how well-balanced their neighbor is, and wish that they had been more accepting of therapy earlier. We'll have a larger portion of adults who don't have a stigma around therapy, and they'll raise their children that way. Positive feedback loop.I'd also like to raise another point there are many people who claim that gun control doesn't work. Fine. So what is it that drives such a frightening number of people to lethal violence in our country that doesn't exist in other countries? What is different about our country compared to other western cultures like Canada or England? If it's not the access to firearms, then surely it must be that there is a sickness lurking at the heart of our society.
