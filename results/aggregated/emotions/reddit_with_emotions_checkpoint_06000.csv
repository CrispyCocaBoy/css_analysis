Furthermore gun violence isn't all violence. There are enough defensive gun uses annually that the side effects of disarming innocent people need to be taken into account, unless you're for trading one tragedy for another.

I am quite willing to have a discussion, it's just not the kind you want because it has nothing to do with guns.I find it fascinating that the glaring and numerous failures of the FBI, the Sheriff's Department and the Parkland school itself are being completely set aside. Had the Sheriff's Department done it's job just once during the 30 some-odd times they were called to the shooters home and arrested him like, I don't know...the time he pointed a gun at his brothers head and threatened to kill him...he would have lost his guns. Had the FBI actually followed up on the tips called into them, the shooting could've been prevented. Had the school actually have pushed for his arrest and actually secured the buildings, the shooting wouldn't have happened. Had the school resource officer confronted the shooter instead of hiding, some people could've been saved....So instead of addressing the failures at almost every level of government and their failures to protect and keep people safe...some of whom it is their literal job to protect people...failures which prove the government can't be counted on to stop such an obvious threat...the left is demanding something be done about guns?

8aa3jl,,"Why toss in that youre a veteran? If true, thank you for your service. Still, how is it relevant to the national discussion? Does you being a veteran mean you get more of a say than someone who didnt serve?Nobody is getting run over at the polls on either side. Both groups are firmly entrenched and vote in bloc. That means the likeliest outcome is continued gridlock. If you want to have an actual conversation, you have to be open to equally-valid, opposite points-of-view. Ill beginYes, we have a violence problem in society. This is not necessarily unique to America, though. In terms of overall deaths, firearm homicides are curiously low when you consider how many there are in circulation. What I think we probably agree on is the disturbing use of violence by unhinged persons. Where I genuinely struggle to identify long-term solutions that specifically address this problem is in balancing the protections afforded for our Rights and freedoms with the possibility of serving society by legally barring unstable persons from not just firearms, but all types of violence that is at their disposal. In my mind, the conversation goes down the road of how do we address individuals prone to violence WHILE protecting the Rights of all Americans, including those we are concerned about because of their history of violence...Any solution that will address this concern needs to also respect the protection of Rights and liberties that we are all endowed with. So, while I agree that it can sound frustrating to hear that your proposed solutions are unacceptable to many in society because they do not adequately consider the aforementioned Rights and liberties, this is actually pretty typical of the idea-forming process. We all have to be willing to throw ideas at the wall without getting insulted when our ideas dont bear fruit because they failed to meet all the necessary criteria. The truth is that if there were an easy solution, we would have already found it. So, if youre willing, Im open to an actual conversation. But this has to be in the spirit of dialogue where we both take into consideration the other persons point-of-view.

8aa3jl,,"Ok, I can accept why you inserted the veteran comment. I agree about the Minority Report bit. Im not sure how we address it either. Where I disagree is in the only option comment. Frankly, we have many options. We, in fact, have so many options that we dont even know what all of them are at this point. In any conversation or discussion where we limit ourselves to only one option, we imply that our mind is made up and the discussion is over. Im hoping that isnt the case here. Perhaps Im reading tone into your parting comment, but it feels rather biting for the sort of conversation I was trying to engender. I offered my puzzlement to the problem and was curious about ideas for addressing violence. The idea you did offer doesnt work for meand presumably otherswho are not willing to budge on infringement of any of our Rights or liberties. Still, we should try and discuss the problem from the perspective of identifying a mutually-agreeable solution. Im wondering what sorts of mental health supports we could implement to address violence from the perspective of long-term solutions. My premise is that we didnt create violent individuals overnight, so its unlikely we will solve the problem in short order either. In terms of firearms legislation, as I read through your comments, it sounds like most of the ideas youve presented already exist in one form or another. As such, perhaps the breakdown in our communication is in the enforcement or oversight of those laws and statutes. Without going down the road of enacting new legislation per se, what are your thoughts about creating a better communicationenforcementoversight network to use the existing laws to both keep firearms from prohibited persons AND to respond to those individuals whoin one form or anotherwere clear red flags that should have been picked up along the way, a la Nick Cruz?In my mind, this is the first step that will provide us with the most return.

8aa3jl,,"We've both repealed amendments and altered them before.Yes, and we have explicit procedure for doing so. The Courts do not amend the Constitution, nor re-interpret it 'for modern times'. The fact that such belief is tolerated in our judiciary is itself a sign and essence of our collapse as a Constitutional Republic.First off, no we are not. That's why the nation is actively having a discussion about which weapons to allow ownership of and which to restrict. First, the nation isn't really having a discussion. A lot of authoritarians, unconcerned with actually understanding the issue themselves, are following the directions of their Authority figures mostly far-left University intelligentsia, and The State itself to march, backed by the overwhelming blast of absurd propaganda just look at this OP for a perfect example from the monolithic state-approved MSM.Second, the single most universal demand of these authority figures is far-reaching bans of all the most common firearms in the country today, which if done, will render the Second Amendment obviated. Recognizing this fact and what it might mean for the ability of any such laws to actually be put into effect, many are very openly calling for the formal repeal of the Second Amendment itself.Some weapons are already restricted, you do realize that correct? Bombs, chemical weapons, etc. We're just adding new weapons to that list for clear reasons.Yes, and these restrictions are legally structured not as straightforward prohibitions, but as prohibitively high taxes, which, later, they decided to stop accepting any payment of or, in some cases, straight-up 'emergency power' executive order martial law. All Federal Gun Control is structured this way by necessity, in order to pass them through the gaping loophole grant of absolute authority of the 16th Amendment personal income tax. They are still illegal on their face, because the Constitutional proscription outweighs the power. This is just the only way they have any slight whiff of legal plausibility a whiff for if you're physically or perceptionally blind.The amendment actually says ""A well regulated militia, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""You fucked up the actual letter of it and the interpretation. I'm not going to bother arguing this, because it was NEVER ACTUALLY A SINCERE ARGUMENT. The purpose of the 'militia' clause was specifically to contextualize the ""ARMS"" that it is ""THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR"" as weapons of war. Go read US V Miller, the first ever SCOTUS gun control case for the first ever national gun control law, circa 19381934 respectively.Also remember when this was written, arms meant musket and cannon fire. And rifles, pistols both rifles and unrifled, volley-guns, bombs 'torpedoes', blades and maces, and war-ships with many cannons which could destroy cities. And probably other things only remembered in history books. And all of these things, the state of the art weaponry of the time, were owned by private, non-state-agent Citizens at the time - which is precisely what the Second Amendment set out to protect.We've progressed in technology as a society and the founding fathers could not have forseen the weapons we create today when writing this law. No, this is either a disingenuous or extremely ignorant argument. Firearms such as are being discussed are fundamentally similar to arms of the time, and certainly nothing that couldn't have been imagined. This argument might have been a good thing to have, at the dawn of the 20th century, when we were watching the advent of aircraft and aerial bombing.

8h7qx7,Start Something,"Hello. My name is Jesse Young. I don't post much on Reddit but I had something I needed to share.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v7g11qzhp1MI live next to Parkland, FL. My wife teaches at an elementary school only a couple of blocks away from Stoneman Douglas. When the shooting happened both her and my daughter were on lockdown because the shooter was missing and within walking distance of their school.A lot of the MSD students are former students of my wife's school, including a few that died. This event has hit very close to home for everyone in this community. We all know people affected by it.Last month we were watching the March for Our Lives and I grabbed my guitar and this song came out. This isn't a political song. I don't know what the solution is to fix all this school violence, but I know something needs to change. I've been inspired by the students of MSD who have decided to take action into their own hands and make a difference. So this song is for them as my way of saying thank you and to keep fighting.I hope when my kids 7 2 go to Douglas, they won't have to worry the way kids do right now. And that parents won't worry like they do now. The problem will never go away but we can do better.This song is really for anyone who sees something that needs change. YOU CAN be the voice or the person to make it so. Stand up, fight for what you believe and never give up.Thank you to anyone who is trying to make a positive difference in people's lives. This world needs as much positivity as it can get.Thank you for taking the time to listen to this song. I hope you enjoy it.Jessehttpswww.youtube.comwatch?v7g11qzhp1M",7,jesseyoungmusic,2018-05-05T14:10:56Z,,0.17,0.16,0.26,0.18,0.12,0.11

Ask us Anything!","EDIT Thanks all for dropping in your questions. That's all the time we have for today's AMA, but we will be on the lookout for any big, lingering questions. Please continue to follow our coverage and support our journalism. We couldn't do this work without your support.PROOF httpsi.redd.it1f3wjeznm8ia1.jpgIn the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High massacre in 2018, we reported for the first time how many children had endured a shooting at a K-12 school since 1999, and the final tally was far higher than what we had expected more than 187,000.Now, just five years later, and despite a pandemic that closed many campuses for nearly a year, the number has exploded, climbing past 331,000.We know that because weve continued to maintain a unique database that tracks the total number of children exposed to gun violence at school, as well as other vital details, including the number of people killed and injured, the age, sex, race and gender of the shooters, the types and sources of their weapons, the demographic makeup of the schools, the presence of armed security guards, the random, targeted or accidental nature of the shootings.Steven is the database editor for the investigations unit at The Washington Post.

We still feel an obligation to tell people who the shooters are and what motivated the violence. Thats fundamental to the job. But were also very careful not to repeat the shooters names or publicize their images unnecessarily. And I think its made a real difference. Whereas most people could name the Columbine shooters, I doubt many could name the Uvalde or Oxford of Michigan State shooters.

The 10 worst assaults account for 57 percent of the entire death toll since 1999, and all but two of them were committed by white attackers, a reality that has left much of the public with the false impression that school shootings almost exclusively affect white students. Children of color, however, are far more likely to experience campus gun violence more than twice as much for Hispanic students and over three times as much for Black students. Shootings at those schools are typically targeted one student shooting one or two others. Fewer casualties almost always result in less media coverage. Based on all my years reporting on this subject, I also believe that shootings in black and brown neighborhoods tend to get less coverage, in general.

Bloomberg the former mayor and other billionaires throw tens of millions of dollars to fund gun control groups. His spending alone utterly dwarfs the NRAs spending, and he is on record stating if they start to catch up hell just dump more at it to outspend them. As a billionaire, he has the ability to do this, and at least hes putting his money where his mouth is.

I was stationed at Fort Hood in 2009. That one happened right across the parking lot from my companys building, and I had friends in there who barely escaped. There is a lot of raw emotion surrounding gun violence. But we cannot make progress on addressing root causes if we are constantly whipped into a hyperbolic frenzy about the gun itself. There are over 600 million guns in the US, and thats just the ones we can track. Pandoras box was opened and theres no going back from it. We need to find ways to work around it and live with them and move forward together, and those solutions do not include getting rid of all the guns. Thats an idealistic pipe dream. Maybe if we didnt hold guns up on this pedestal of being some super powered mythical instant win command respect or fear thing, it wouldnt be the first thing disturbed and deranged people turn to when they lash out. Maybe if we looked at why they felt disenfranchised in the first place and took the hard steps to assess and address those issues commonly poverty economic opportunity, no social safety net, etc we would make more progress. Roughly 6,000 veterans per year commit suicide, with half a little over 3,000 choosing a firearm. Roughly 500 people a year are killed with an assault weaponAR15-style rifle. So by simply addressing veteran issues youd do more to save lives than an assault weapon ban. Thats not a sexy fundraising issue though. Bloomberg isnt shelling out tens of millions and making big public statements about funding veteran support programs or job retraining though he has enough philanthropic efforts Im sure hes got some token thing going around that. Gonna cut myself off here because this is getting long but yeah. Its frustrating to see posts like this AMA that are designed to just rile people up enough to pass some other BS nonsensical gun control legislation that wont budge the needle on violent deaths and will be struck down in a few years anyway.",199,NorCalAthlete,2023-02-16T02:03:41Z,,0.14,0.17,0.20,0.14,0.17,0.17
1137rx6,,"Having to chop this into 2 parts as I hit Reddits comment limit, sorry -Posting this as a separate comment for further discussion I feel like many times we never get much further than shooting down each others arguments, so Im going to attempt to drive past that with some proposals of gun control measures I think actually might do some good.1. No more law enforcement exemptions. Equal footing across the board. Quit the class warfare. Of law enforcement gets full auto SBRs, so should the average person. Body armor? You betcha. Armored vehicles? Sure, why not. Either we all have access or nobody does. 2. Secure background checks available to all, instantly. It doesnt have to retain your info, but we live in a day and age where we can pull up medical and criminal records on our phones on the fly - I see no reason we cant have a system where NICS can be available to everyone, not just FFLs, so that even a private party transfer can have someone input their info and it simply spits out a green light red light yes theyre good to go or no theyre a prohibited person. Doesnt need to track whether or not they already own a gun, doesnt need to retain information that they just made a purchase, just at this time this person is good to go. THAT is a universal background check that I think everyone could get on board with, vs the current only-available-to-FFLs system. 3. Reimplement gun safety training in schools. If we can do sex ed, drugs, etc, under the guise of theyre going to encounter it sooner or later, they should be prepared to understand and know the consequences, I see no reason not to include basic firearm safety with this. They dont have to shoot live ammo or blanks or actually get any range time, but SHOULD understand how to safely check to see if a gun is loaded and unload it. They should understand to keep it pointed in a safe direction, keep their finger off the trigger at all times, and assume every gun they encounter is loaded until proven otherwise. Its not difficult. 4. Take suppressors off the NFA list. Its only courteous. Or at least allow threaded barrels and such so that they may be rented or freely available for use at practice ranges. Contrary to Hollywood belief suppressed gunshots are still LOUD and recognizable as gunshots. It just lessens the hearing damage and noise pollution from outdoor ranges. 5. If youre going to insist on licensing, then Im going to insist on tiered licensing and compromise speaking to the general you, here, not necessarily the person Im replying to. So for example at tier 1, you have to pass a basic safety test, and then can buy anything up to say, a 9mm semi-auto, a 20ga shotgun semi or otherwise, or .22 rifle any kind. Renew every 10 years. Tier 2 might be something like Tier 1 you can go up to a .44 mag pistol, .30-06 rifle, 12ga shotgun, plus mail order ammo to your house in bulk, etc. Renew every 5 years. Tier 3 is Tier 2 CCW, NFA items ie full auto, SBRs, suppressors, etc. Renew every 2 years.",20,NorCalAthlete,2023-02-16T08:24:22Z,,0.17,0.17,0.20,0.11,0.15,0.18
1137rx6,,"6. Waiting periods. 7 days so as to coincide with consistent days off work schedule weekend, only apply to your first gun the aforementioned NICS flag is easy to make where it simply is a Boolean truefalse for already a gun owner status, and exemptions for urgency such as a restraining order stalker, immediate threats, etc. It makes no sense that under current versions of so-called cooling off waiting periods I can literally walk into a gun store with a gun on my hip and still have to wait another 10 days for the next gun. 7. Quit the shenanigans with treating gun ranges the same way Texasred states do abortion clinics. Id rather have people who can aim and hit their target over people who spray and hit bystanders. Most homicides are targeted beef. Let it end with that and not catch 6 other people 100 yards away down the block if someone is pissed off enough to abuse it. Im not saying gun ranges should be as plentiful as Starbucks, but from a safe use perspective, you shouldnt have to drive 2 hours away to get some practice in, either. Not everyone has that option. No random requirements that seem reasonable but magically preclude a gun range from operating. 8. Mandatory sunset clauses. If new gun control laws cannot be proven to have had the measurable impact on gun safety they were purported to in order to pass, they get rolled back. Quit piling on when you know its not going to do anything. 9. Ease up on the plea bargains. Gun charges for people who have actually used them to commit crimes from murder to robbery are often the first thing dropped in sentencing. Fuck that. If youre going to pound the gun control drum for assault weapons and everything, dont then turn around and pardon httpswww.turnto23.comnewscrimebakersfield-family-asks-for-justice-after-gov-newsom-pardons-killer while he was already on the ground wounded from the first shot to his back. They shouldnt be bargaining chips. And Im not talking about oh he got a DUI and happened to have a gun in the car, by all means negotiate on dumb stuff like that where nobody was hurt. But if someone literally killed another person with a gun during a robbery or something...no plea bargain. None. Maaaaaaaybe if theyre giving up a bigger fish, but thats it. In a similar vein - lying on a background check form 4473 is currently punishable by up to 10 years in jail and a 250,000 fine. Out of hundreds of thousands who have failed their background check, fewer than a couple dozen have actually been charged for it. Thats some really, really low hanging fruit not being enforced. So the fact that we have people clamoring for more laws while ignoring criminals handing themselves to law enforcement on a silver platter just doesnt make sense to me. 10. Capping this list at 10 for now its long enough as it is. Ive probably managed to upset both some pro-gun people and anti-gun people with this list. Thats fine. Thats how you know its actually a compromise. So to finish the list taxes. Gun control has become well, maybe always was a class warfare issue. If youre wealthy enough, no matter what state you live in, you can get any type of firearm you want. Yes, even in California. And yes, even tanks! Gun control advocates have proposed severely increased taxes and fees on guns, ammunition, and gun parts, ignoring that theyve already been sharply increased several times in the past. If you think 20 is too much for a voter ID, and impedes the right to vote, then you should also be upset at things like a 200 tax stamp to get a suppressor for a firearm - its not even the actual firearm, just a part! When the NFA was passed, if adjusted for inflation it would be like being asked to pay 3500 for a gun part. That puts it squarely out of reach of most lower and even middle class people. Guns are an extension of the right to self defense and bodily autonomy, among other things. Guns are not solely for the wealthy, or for Hollywood. As long as they are manufactured to a certain minimum safety standard, ie dont go off randomly when dropped or something.",25,NorCalAthlete,2023-02-16T08:24:48Z,,0.16,0.16,0.17,0.16,0.18,0.17

1137rx6,,"Thanks for the latest. I dont know how much of the recent shift in proportions can be attributed to normal issues vs pandemic issues though. On average, over the last few decades, it has held relatively steady at rounding for numbers sake something like30k deaths, out of which 20k are suicides8k are gang related1k are police involved Leaving 1k unjustified including mass shootings and the like. The numbers HAVE spiked in the last few years. The pandemic has introduced new stressors, there have been more instances of police brutality sparking protests, under the cover of which bad actors have preyed on other innocents, leading to further loss of life. The economy has been all over the place, and loss of job is a pretty common factor in suicide. And yet. From your most recent figures the majority of gun violence deaths are STILL suicide. Homicides, even factoring in gang related and, by the way, the Guardian link on locality bears reposting still remain relatively low. 25k 330,000k. Can we do better? Absolutely. I simply disagree about how we might go about that, and believe that if we campaigned for, funded, and preached about things that would actually move the needle instead of just rah rah ban guns, we would have made more significant progress by now. Gun control, imo, is a losing cause, and always has been. I would wager that a significant enough chunk of single issue voters would vote Democrat, if not for gun control, that Democrats would win in an overwhelming landslide in any state or election that wasnt staunchly a Republican stronghold. And the way theyve been imploding lately, I would say even those areas might be winnable....if not for gun control. Gun owners are quite possibly THE most diverse voting demographic in the US.

1137rx6,,"Australia's gun violence was already on a decline before the ban though, and the ban itself only garnered something like a 10 compliance rate. So I don't think that's a particularly good example template to uphold, despite how often it gets brought up. Like, gun violence in general was already statistically insignificant there, and a single mass shooting was a blip. As for semi-auto handguns being overlooked in legislation - they're not overlooked, it's a very intentional part of a disinformation campaign on behalf of gun control groups. re rifles assault weapons that are typically the focus of new gun control lawsThe term ""assault weapon"" became widely used starting the late 1980s.

To address your other points, semi-auto handguns are actually typically MORE expensive than revolvers, and concealability is a wash - they're both easily concealable and roughly the same size depending on model and there are so many models of each it's a pointless generalization some revolvers are indeed too massive to conveniently conceal, and some semi-autos are the same. In the US, unfortunately we have several examples of mass shooters using non-semi-automatic clunky term for bolt action or single shot, but hammers the point home better I think guns. Primary among them being the Austin clock tower shooter. Additionally, I might point out that California's big thing for gun control is the so-called ""SAFE"" roster and microstamping laws, with the theory being a firing pin will leave a readily-identifiable mark on shell casings left at a crime scene that law enforcement can trace back to the gun owner. Ease of removing said markings aside, this microstamping is completely nullified by simply carrying a revolver, which doesn't automatically eject shell casings as you shoot. Lastly, to address the thought of ""nullifying the idea of carrying a firearm to feel safe"" - carrying a firearm is a whole separate issue from a semi-automatic ban. That being said, semi-automatics tend to be the weapon of choice, so perhaps there's at least more of a tenuous link between those than your other points.

There will always be guns in society, and by limiting the average citizens ability to defend themselves only more violence will be created.What I, as a high school senior, believe would be more effective measures in preventing gun violence, specifically in schools, is not more restrictions on every day citizens but rather better mental health screening and aid for troubled individuals, better cooperation between departments to make sure people who are not fit to posses firearms get flagged so they fail the background check to purchase them, and members of a schools staff who are deemed mentally capable to be armed. Police take, on average, 11 minutes to respond and have less knowledge of what is going on than those already at the scene.

For some reason, thats when we consider it to have all began its not, its just the first publicized occurrence.That was in 1999, halfway through the Assault Weapons Ban, which had the effect of limiting access to firearms like the AR-15. So, it is worth noting that the era of school shooting begins during the strictest period of firearms law in the United States.In 2004, the Assault Weapons Ban lapsed to much wailing and gnashing of teeth or applause and celebration depending on political leaning.Nothing happens.No, seriously. Nothing happens. The FBI collects and tracks crime data in the Uniform Crime Report. Over the years, you will see a trend beginning in the late 1980s of violence beginning to decrease that continues through until today. The AWB came and went, and there is nary a bump in the trend line to signal its existence. Violence, of any type, neither improved nor worsened relative to a slow decay experienced by almost the entire developed world.California, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, and several other states and individual cities enact legislation to control the type and use of firearms within their jurisdictions in response to the lapse of the Assault Weapons Bans or the ebb and flow of political tides.Nothing happens.In several states, Constitutional Carry passes, enabling citizens without criminal records to bear arms in public without individual licensure.Nothing happens.Concealed Carry Reciprocity passes, forming a network of states that each recognize each others license, allowing those with out-of-state licenses to bear arms in public.Nothing happens.Bump stocks and binary triggers appear, each purporting to increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic firearms.Nothing happens.An executive order is released to ban bump stocks under the assumption that they increase lethality.Nothing happens.The problems we have today absolutely were problems 20 or 30 years ago, and we havent been ignoring them, either. Weve simply been chasing ineffective solutions.Edit I should also mention that several major universities now allow their students to bear arms on campus, a change that was met with the sound of thundering crickets.",13,GreatBlueNarwhal,2019-02-14T20:09:32Z,,0.14,0.14,0.25,0.17,0.17,0.13

Most mass shootings are actually committed with handguns, and most handguns are semi-automatic, yet you dont really see that being talked about in bans. Machine guns or fully automatic firearms have long been banned and require intensive special licenses to own now. Politicians weaponize which guns looks most scary and while AR-15s have been used in some of the deadliest shootings we have had, even those have lots of different types. I dont say this to just illustrate how the left is stupid, just that if were going to enact effective legislation then maybe its time everyone who is so passionate about this do about 15 minutes of actual research and learn the differences so we can know what exactly needs to be banned.The vaccine example another commenter posted I think is a really good analogy.

I am sure some of the staff had opinions. I never felt unsafe in that school. I knew students that were there when the shooting happened and they weren't afraid for their safety. I also had a 2nd cousin that was a student at Columbine. I will point out a few things about a nation wide strike idea. In my state teachers are not allowed to be in a union therefore no job protection for walking out. Public School teachers are considered state employees and very few state employees in my state have the ability to form a union for collective bargaining. I think it is mostly Firefighters that can. Secondly all that is needed to defend the 2nd Amendment is 17 states. You need 34 to pass an amendment. I will point out I know of at least 13 states including Georgia will vote to keep the 2nd Amendment.Instead of talking gun control lets talk about dealing with the root causes of these shootings. In most cases including the one at my school the shooter was being bullied. We need more mental health counseling in the country period. We need smaller classroom sizes. We absolutely need smaller schools. My home county has 6 out of 12 non charter or private high schools that are 1500 students. When I was in high school we didn't have 9th grade on campus simply because the school building could not hold 3000 students. What people aren't talking about is the schools are too big that it is hard to police the root causes of these events. Finally we need to address school funding. This includes teacher pay.

1j9iw13,Teaching Outside Your Subject,"Not sure if I have the right flair. This morning, I was listening to the radio and was reminded of the day my music theory teacher in high school spent a day talking about gun violence. It was around the time of the parkland shooting in 2018. A lot of us were on edge and he could tell. One day that week, we talked about gun violence, how it affects our schoolscountry, and how we can stop it. It certainly wasnt the most in-depth discussion, and in hindsight, we didnt touch on nearly enough, but it showed me he cared about our concerns enough to address them and let us talk it out. It also hit the point home harder for me, hearing it come from my music teacher of all people. If even hes talking about it, this must be important, right?How do you feel about taking a break from your normal subject for a day to educate your students on social issues that affect them? Personally, I feel this is worthwhile, even imperative. How else are we supposed to raise the next generation to make positive change in the world if we shelter them from difficult topics?",3,JGilly117,2025-03-12T12:28:16Z,,0.13,0.13,0.34,0.16,0.11,0.13
941cup,Why My Contract Wasn't Renewed,"This is long. I'm trying to be as concise as possible, but there's a lot that went on.TLDR Listen to people when they tell you to keep your head down and your mouth shut.So, to give a little bit of context for those outside the US. After the Parkland shooting where 17 students died, Parkland students planned a national protest for students to walk out of school at 10 a.m. If I remember correctly, they were also going to have moment of silence for 17 minutes, one minute for every student who died.When I became aware of the protests, I talked to my 8th graders about it. We discussed why it was happening, what it was about, and what to think about if they decided to participate. I gave students a chance to discuss if they agreed or disagreed with the protests and the reasons it was happening. Overall, it was a very civil discussion, and we moved on.As it became closer to the protests, our school sent out a series of emails. One was from some higher up, saying students shouldn't protest. Another said that only high schoolers were allowed to protest. The ACLU sector of my state even sent out letters to all of the Superintendents reminding them that students have the constitutional right to protest. All of this culminated in a meeting with our Principal the day of, during which the 8th grade teachers were told that it was our job to stand in front of the doors and prevent students from walking out.This is when I'd had enough.During the meeting I told my Principal, I'm sorry, but I can't do this. She said that's fine, I'll write you up for insubordination. I said I understand, and that's a conversation that we can have later, but I can't do this. She told me there would be no conversation, I would be written up. I told her okay.I spent a long time considering if I was really willing to do this. If it was a fight I really wanted to have. I called my husband and talked to him about it. We talked about if it was worth the risk of getting fired. I talked to another teacher who I knew was written up and discussed what it meant for my license or my career at the school.In the end I decided not to stand by the door. I could not, in good conscience, tell my students that I support their right to protest, and then participate in something that was getting in the way of them doing that. It was hypocritical and I would have no part in it. In addition to that, I was also 7 months pregnant and I did not want to put myself in a situation where I could potentially get hurt.The time came and went. I chose to stand in the cafeteria that was designated as a ""safe"" place for the students who left class to protest. I wanted to show them whatever support I could, and the day moved on.A few days later my Principal calls me into the office and we have our ""discussion."" The conversation can be summed up in her statement of ""If you can't do what you're told, I don't think this is the profession for you."" She seemed to take it as a personal offense to her that I wouldn't do what she asked. I tried my best to be respectful, to make it clear that it wasn't her I had a problem with, and that I understood she was doing what was asked of her by the superintendent, but none of that mattered.So, at the end of the school year, I go on my maternity leave. The last day of school for teachers was the 25th and I asked my principal if I could come unofficially since I was still on leave just to say hello to everyone before summer break and introduce everyone to the baby. She says that's fine. I go. I talked to everyone. I talk to my principal, tell everyone that I hope they have a good summer and I'll see them next year.When I come home, I get a letter in the mail saying that my contract wasn't renewed.Some days, I still don't know if I made the right choice. I now have a daughter who has no insurance as of yesterday. I've been unable to find a new job. And we bought a house right before I got the letter. If I could have just done what I was told I wouldn't be in this situation, but I just hate that there's is so much backstabbing in some administrations.I understand that what I did was insubordination. I understand that there are consequences, but I also feel like the least my principal could have done was tell me that my contract wasn't going to be renewed to give me the chance of finding a new job. There was no need to wait until the very last day of school, and there was no reason she couldn't tell me to my face. And knowing that she's a person who gossips and can't keep a secret, I'm also upset that no one who knew thought to trust me with the secret and tell me my job was gone.I see a lot of new teachers asking for advice, and a lot of people say to wait until you have tenure to speak up.

Also again with the hindsight you should find out what the Union can and will do for you, rather than assume. Though I don't blame you for not wanting to fight all that hard, and risk having to go back to work for the same principal.Regarding your other comment, I think you should consider applying to your old school if you can get a feel for the current climate from old co-workersfriends, especially if the principal is gone.

u8oopt,Teachers of 2018 Parkland Reaction?,"If youre someone who lived on the planet of Earth during 2018, youve probably heard of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland Florida. If you were a student, teacher, or parent of a student in America during this time, youve probably felt that gut wrenching devastation and fear that came with watching something like that shooting go down. Parkland shook America. If you were a teacher during this time, the point of this post is to get your feelings on the matter, but specifically, how did you go aboutfeel about the student orchestrated protests held at schools, during school days and hours, all across America whether they were allowed by the school or not? Like for example, did you support these protests and uproars? Did you disapprove? And etc. I was in 7th grade when parkland happened and I havent been the same since. That very February, I ended up getting suspended along with two other students because we left our school with intentions to properly protest gun violence in schools. I remember there being a divide in opinions between the teachers at my school. Some of them were strictly unsupportive of these protests, some were supportive and understanding, some were in the middle. These reactions caused me to be curious about other teacherly stances outside of my community, so Im asking now! Thank you",1,astralluvr,2022-04-21T14:18:01Z,,0.05,0.32,0.21,0.26,0.09,0.08

8lobs9,"Had an ""realistic"" active shooter drill today... Oof","So I'm a first year teacher in a school that is considerably larger than the one I went to and security is taken very seriously. Especially after a recent scare in a neighboring district kids called 911 saying there was a shooter as a ""prank"" admins decided we should have a realistic shooter drill to see what problems there were with protocol and protecting students. The building was cleared of students before the drill started so that was at least one positive. We had no real warning, after have the gist of the drill being explained basically, you won't actually be shot and you'll know when it starts we were told to go about our day as usual. I went back to my room and waited. There was no announcement, just shots. I locked my door and went to where my students would be and just listened. The worst part was hearing the actors screaming ""he's killing me, help me"" and knowing that I couldn't do a damn thing because I had to protect the ""students"" in my room already. I had to let this girl die to save my students. It must be a special kind of hell for the teachers and students that survived parkland, Sandy Hook and all the other places that shootings have happened. I knew it was fake and that scream has still stuck with me. I just pray that it never happens for real.

He has always had behaviorauthority issues and is just kind of off.... in a creepy way. So yesterday he got in trouble and an argument with the teacher he has the period before me. He was clearly really mad so I just gave him space to cool off. During my class, I caught him off task on the laptops using a program we have that allows teachers to see students screens. When I started looking, I saw that he was looking up all of his teachers personal information including cell phone numbers, home addresses, and personal email accounts. He was making a PowerPoint, one slide dedicated to each teacher and all their information. This was really creepy to me especially because he was already so angry that I reported it to my admin. Whelp, found out today he was expelled from our school, that this was the last straw. I didnt realize me reporting that information would get him expelled, and now Im worried that he may come back for revenge. I teach at a school in Florida so the Parkland shooting is something always in our minds. The shooter from Parkland had just been expelled and then came back and did what he did...... what if this student does that? Would I be his target because I got him kicked out?? Would I be the reason this student came back and attacked innocent studentsteachers? I hate that this is the way teachers have to think now.

Why were the Freedom Summer murders? Why do we remember the things we remember. Note I'm not saying this is the same issue because I know someone will misread this if this post gets any traction. The American Civil Rights movement is just a really good example of this series of starts and stops that seemed to bubble over with change, when really the seeds had been heavily sewn for several decades of relatively little movement on the issues at hand and even plenty of regressions. I think that's where we are now with a lot of things, including this. Everything in history that changes anything becomes the tip of the iceberg. We don't see the whole thing usually unless you study it in depth, of course. We see the big moments. And those moments are picked by the collective psyche of mankind in some weird way, by fate sometimes, and they are the moments that generate change. I'm not sure Parkland will become the tip of the iceberg. It may be part of it, but it may take more to get to the truly defining and culminating moment. It's WAY too early to tell. But it feels different, you're right. Why? Because change doesn't happen over night. And it doesn't happen because some politician declares it. Change comes from the people.

8guu2v,need legalethical help about student threatening to shoot staff in the head.,"Need legalethicalmoral suggestions pls!Work at a self-contained school for students with severe EBD. My para and I are BOTH firm with rules, but some of the high schoolers really dislike my para basically have issues with women giving them directions. One student in particular had a rough year all around with everyone, but particularly her, and eventually ranted about putting a bullet in her brainthis was 3ish days after Parkland. The cops should have been called so much earlier, but that was the last straw, I talked to the SRO, got the ball rolling, student was arrested for terroristic threats, and spent two-ish weeks in jail before being bailed out. I know some staff thought my para and I were over-reacting, and some people were being jerks and passive aggressive about how they werent scared blah blah blah, but Ive stuck by my para and been supportive because no, being EBD doesnt mean you can scream about shooting people in the head with no consequences. Dude is 17.Anyways, kid made bail, is out, but no court date to determine anything, and he was actually eager to come back to school. Para not ok with that, says she will quit if he comes back and she is a fabulous para, I love her understandably, so I worked with ppl and plead our case, and student was put on home-ish bound, in theory to allow him to catch up and focus on his work without students asking him what went on, etc. but there is no court order that says he cant come to school.so then we came to end of course testing. Para was like wait, what, he has to come in to test? Yes, he does, do you want to take those days off, I will make sure there is no contact, but I can tell she is still upset and thinks it is unfair.Then today I found out that he is asking if he can participate in some end of the year activities, and he will most likely be coming back next year. Para is livid, saying she still has the ability to take out an order of protection against him and will quit if he comes back to school and will testify in court as to that effect. I dont know what to do. I want to be supportive and I want her as my para, but this kid has a right to an education, hes not incarcerated, he not inpatient, and if Dad really wants to make a fuss he could bring up the fact that we have students who HAVE physically hurt teachers, served time in RYDC, and came back to school. We have mentally ill students who HAVE actually brought weapons including guns to school, and after serving time, have returned to school. I honestly feel that if she pursues the personal protection order, she will be transferred to another school, because a right to FAPE trumps a right to employment and our contracts stipulate that we can be reassigned to another school at any time.What should I do? Do you think this student SHOULD be allowed back at school? I and FYI, kid has shown absolutely no remorse and is super pissy that we got him in trouble. I will be heartbroken if she leaves, but I cant keep fighting this.EDITED TO ADD one of the other big stressors is that the other teachers dont really think the situation was really that bad, and are irritated about all the extra work we have to do pulling together materials and lesson to be sent home, and the fact that we have to test him separately, etc.",3,Blueathena623,2018-05-03T23:34:23Z,,0.12,0.15,0.22,0.19,0.16,0.17

8bey95,USA Middle SchoolSS,"Warning Really, really long story but even shortened there is a lot to explain. I never thought I would be asking for help on something like this but I need advice on how to frame my time at my last school as I begin to job search again. I took a job this year at an urban middle school after two years go being a successful elementary school teacher. To put it bluntly, it was the worst mistake of my progressional life. Besides being out of my element with this new location, grade level and subject matter am certified, never taught, I shared a classroom with two different teachers for almost six months with no real divider as we waited to move into a new building, had no projector or smart board in a technology heavy 11 school, had no support for the fifth of my grade who spoke little to english or was pushed-in from the self-contained class as that was only for tested subjects and was teaching a grade level that had such a high amount of students with behavior issues that it required a meeting in which my principal asked the parents to talk to their kids because after over 800 write-ups in five months they didn't know what to do anymore.I struggled in a way I never struggled before. I did everything you could imagine to make my lessons the best they could be and manage the behaviors in my classroom. I worked a minimum of 70 hours a week. I also observed other teachers, asked for help often and tried every strategy I could but because of these issues that I now admit were out of control and also kept changing every time I felt I had a handle on things a new policy or school setup changed, my classes became more and more out of control.In response, I was a burnt out mess. I was having multiple nervous breakdowns a week, had a terrible stress-induced crohns's flare up that lasted over a month and would burst into tears multiple times a week not in front of students but co-workers and administrators which I think only happened twice before that and it was only to teachers I was friends with. I prayed that I would someone leave this job.I ended up getting my wish in the worst way possible.One day in class the students were working on a choice board project. This was one of rougher classes with a lot of challenging students including one who was determined to disrupt the class in whatever way he could. The student who I will called Zee would yell, run around my class, play on his computer with the sound all the way on and tell other students to stop working because my class was stupid and didn't matter. I did every possible consequence in my power but his behavior continued to worsen.I was helping a student with something when I overhead another student say the Zee was talking about bombings and how a muslim student in my class could help him. I didn't hear a lot but I did say I was going to follow up and write-up the behavior. I wrote up the fact that racist comments were made that next morning but what Zee said about bombings didn't really hit me until I hit send on my write-up. I barely heard how Zee was talking about bombing school but this was literally a few days after the Parkland shooting occurred. On one hand, Zee said crazy stuff all the time although nothing about weapons and bombs but it always was to just get a reaction. He was disruptive but ultimately he was a 12 year-old boy who wanted attention. But I kept thinking what if it was something this time. I would never forgive myself if I said nothing and I put my students' lives in danger. So when my supervisor popped his head in my class I asked to talk to him and explain what I thought I heard in class. I was expecting him to thank me and find the student to talk to him. We never talked about what happened in Parkland and how to respond to a situation like this. And teaching only elementary, this never was an issue before.Instead, he got very angry at me and asked why I didn't tell him this sooner. Taken aback I said how I told him as soon as I remembered and also with Zee he tended to say intense and disruptive things all the time and you had to take things with him with a grain of salt. But when I realized the next day the what what he said could mean, I got him right away.My supervisor tried to find Zee but he wasn't in school that day so a full investigation was done to see if the claims were real or not. Everyone was involved and they even his house was searched. Nothing was found, Zee was just talking crap to look cool and annoy the muslim student who he was fighting with that week.Despite it all being okay, my principal finds me during lunch and tells me that because of what happened I should talk to my union rep and see them after school. I am in shock and terrified because this is the last thing I expected to happen. I find of the reps and immediately begin crying My amazing rep, once she heard the whole story, first told me my work conditions were terrible and should have talked to her sooner. And in response to the incident, she assured me that I wouldn't get fired but would probably get a write up in my personnel file and reprimanded. The timing wasn't good but I didn't do it on purpose and I was as timely as I could possibly be considering I forgot about the main comment.One part was right. It was put in my personnel file. But I was told I made a gross misjudgment because I should have hit the red button and asked for a supervisor right away. But because of my classes being as chaotic as they were I didn't and put hundreds of lives in danger. Because of that I was fired but I had the option to resign in order to control my narrative. If allowed myself to be fired I would have to work 60 more days but if i resigned I would stop working as soon as I sent the letter. My rep was surprised and shocked at how that went but explained that treatment like this was not a new thing. I asked her what to do and she said I should resign. After the way I was treated I do not owe them any more work, and knowing me I could still get a job in childcare to support myself. So I resigned but surprisingly enough I left on really good terms with my principal and administration? They all wished me luck in finding a better matched school and my supervisor offered to write me a reference letter explaining the goods things they can say if they are asked and that I left the school on good terms.I got a job as a nanny and was planning on applying later in the year but found out there is a big teacher job fair coming up. There will be 29 districts including first district I ever worked at and this district is nice enough to not need job fairs to recruit so I'm super excited. I was loved at this district but it being a leave replacement it was only temporary and loved working there. I really want to impress them again and return and in normal circumstances, I probably would have. But here are my worries and the questions I need answers to.1. How the heck do I explain why I left? I'm not going to mention the incident unless they see my file and ask but my resume still says I left mid-year and I know how bad that looks. On one hand, I don't want to look like a complainer talking about how horrible my last school was. But on the other hand, I want people to understand that my situation was not typical. If I left, it was for a damn good reason so just because I didn't want to work to fix things. So if I am asked what happened, what do I say? Can I convey how terrible the school was without actually saying how terrible the school was?2. Do people actually check your personnel file? I was told it barely happens but it must happen sometimes. And it's going to say a little bit about the incident. So is there a way to explain that?Thank you in advance to all help!",3,throwawayacct201,2018-04-11T06:18:37Z,,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17

x0lisn,What Governor DeSantis Did Is Un-American and Undemocratic Four School Board Members Suspended Following Parkland Mass Shooting Report,,33850,alabasterheart,2022-08-29T10:42:25Z,,,,,,,
x0lisn,,"So I'm confused about so much more than what is said in this article. A grand jury was created to investigate the Parkland High School shooting. Okay fine. It's not inconceivable that someone would want to know whether there was a failure of administration that led to the shooting and whether someone could be charged. But it is notable that the decision to create the grand jury would have been made by a republican, and the school administration is mostly democratic.The grand jury apparently doesn't pursue any criminal charges, but releases a report on its findings. That's weird because that's not what grand juries do. In any case the report is confidential because all documents related to grand juries are confidential. This report finds that there was negligence and incompetence among School Board Administration in Broward county. But didn't recommend charges. Again very weird. This report was released in April of 2021. No actions were taken. But in August of 2022, 60 days before an election, the governor unseals a report and dismisses four members of the school board named as having been incompetent. Importantly he does this while a jury is actually deliberating on the fate of the shooter.He does nominally have the power to dismiss public officials who have committed a gross breach of Duty, but the timing is bizarre and just not referenced in the article. And now he can appoint four Replacements to an otherwise Democratic majority School board. Again, allowed under the law but very unusual.",4761,BigBennP,2022-08-29T11:28:58Z,,0.12,0.18,0.24,0.14,0.16,0.16

x0lisn,,"Basically the Constitution says each state must have at least one member in the House of Representatives and that if a state has more than one district, they must be of roughly equal population. Currently the House is also locked to 435 members which causes a lot of issues with properly representing how many members a large state gets and states get to draw their own districts. Each state does it differently with some having an independent commission doing it to lessen gerrymandering while others are made by the state legislature. There are also some rules that must be followed to make sure districts arent being drawn to exclude minorities. Like lets say one area is a majority African American and the population is big enough to warrant its own district, the lines cant be drawn in a way to break it up and split that population up into say four districts, because that would be discrimination. The biggest issue right now is the amount of gerrymandering and the fact that some legislatures have found out that there arent really consequences for drawing unconstitutional districts. The court system is supposed to send the map back if it has issues, but nothing is stopping the legislature from sending the same map back with some slight changes that dont address the issue. Eventually the election comes and a map has to be used, and guess what the only one available is.Edit 435 instead of 385 members in the House.",23,Rbespinosa13,2022-08-29T13:20:25Z,,0.17,0.14,0.23,0.15,0.16,0.16

Don't get me wrong Asshole cops are out there and so are criminal cops. But let's not forget that it is the job of our government, our elected officials, to create the kind of society that doesn't produce a mass murder every 4 or 5 months. Here are some things that would have helped this person out 1 free healthcare for his ADHD and depression. 2 A reasonable expectation at a satisfying life as a participating member of society, whether he is employed or not. 3 Free college education. Probably it would have reduced this young man's anxiety to know that if he didn't guess exactly right about what he should do with the rest of his life at age 17-18 that he wouldn't be paying interest on the loans he took out while he played out the process of working out his path in life. Maybe this kid would have still been as asshole. That is still better than being homicidal.

MLK and the others certainly led the movements, but they were equally as influenced by the every day participants.I guess my point in bringing this up is that leaders in these movements are important, but they're only as powerful as the people they're leading.These kids seem to be taking all the right steps to make change happen though, it's exciting to watch.

And finding space within that to convince people it's OK to ask for help is difficult.EDIT Just to be clear, this isn't a statement against better mental health access for Americans.

7xpqwo,,"True. However, studies show that it takes one or two generations for a fundamental cultural shift. Start out in schools with therapists directly working with kids - help the bullied kid to not internalize the abuse they're receiving so that it doesn't affect their self image help the bully work through whatever it is that is driving them to lash out at those around them. Work with the kid who is posting pictures of dead animals to their instagram. Not all kids will accept therapy since their parents will be against it, but once those kids who did accept the help that therapy can give grow up, we'll have a much larger portion of well balanced adults. People who didn't receive therapy when they were a child might look at how well-balanced their neighbor is, and wish that they had been more accepting of therapy earlier. We'll have a larger portion of adults who don't have a stigma around therapy, and they'll raise their children that way. Positive feedback loop.I'd also like to raise another point there are many people who claim that gun control doesn't work. Fine. So what is it that drives such a frightening number of people to lethal violence in our country that doesn't exist in other countries? What is different about our country compared to other western cultures like Canada or England? If it's not the access to firearms, then surely it must be that there is a sickness lurking at the heart of our society. We must do everything we can to cure this sickness, and I think both mental health care and education are the most powerful tools when can bring to bear against it.",10,KapitanWalnut,2018-02-15T15:14:07Z,,0.19,0.16,0.26,0.10,0.14,0.16

Either America has a disproportionate case of the crazies or theres an underlying issue. Much like heart disease or diabetes, every country on the planet has mental health issues, but they aren't having monthly mass shootings. Look I can side with the argument that more background checks and limiting firearm sales probably wouldn't stop the problem. Most of these shooters are using someone else's gun. I believe the solution lies with accountability. My guns are all in a safe that ONLY I know the combination to, all have a trigger lock, with keys that ONLY I have. If my wife or child or a friend wants to use one, that's fine, but I'll be with them and ensure they use it responsibly. If all gun owners all had this mentality, I guarantee there would be a significant drop in these shootings. First step is openly talking about the issue and then potentially implementing harsh criminal penalties to anyone whose firearm is used in any form of illegal activity. Most importanly allocate some money towards educating consumers on safely guarding their guns from even friends and family. Unfortunately Republicans don't even want to talk about it for fear of backlash from their constituents and donors, so instead we get thoughts and prayers and the clock is reset anxiously awaiting the next incident.If people guarded their firearms as well as they guard their atm pins, alot of this problem would correct itself.",8,mechapman38,2018-02-15T14:12:55Z,,0.13,0.10,0.19,0.15,0.23,0.20

If there is one force that is ruining this country more than any other, more than any president or organization or policy, it's FEAR. America is irrational fearful and paranoid of so much.Xenophobia. Racism. Sexism. Homophobia. They are all born from fear.Is this the kinda country we aspire to be? Land of the fearful, home of the afraid. Is that what makes America great? What does the NRA and their ilk use to promote their agenda? Fear. ""They're gonna take away your guns! They wanna leave you defenseless as a bad guy shoots up your kid's school!"" Fear is what they're selling, and fear is what America is buying.Or Fox News. Again, merchants of fear. ""The Deep State is destroying America from within! Liberal pizza rapists are letting Mexican socialists cast illegal votes for Hillary!"" Fear is what they're showing, and fear is what America is tuning in for.It's fuckin ridiculous. The amount of knee jerk irrational hatred and paranoia that rules this country. Of course, it's not a recent phenomenon. We were born out of fear and paranoia and hate. It's why we wiped out the natives. Its why we had to fight a civil war over black slavery. It's why we banned certain ethnicities or nationalities from coming here. It's why we had Jim Crow. It's why we interred Americans of Japanese descent in concentration camps. It's why an entire generation is repulsed by the word ""socialism"" meaning we can't have universal healthcare and not be burdened for life for choosing to go to college.But I guess there's one thing we don't fear. We don't fear gun violence. Columbine didn't make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Aurora didn't make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Virginia Tech didn't make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Fucking Sandy Hook didn't make us afraid enough. Las Vegas didn't make us afraid enough. Parkland, Florida won't either. Because the fear of more restrictions on gun rights is greater than the fear of a gun's right to restrict life I guess.So. Is this what the fuck America is? Have we, particularly those on the right, decided that we need to be constantly afraid, clutching to our AR-15s against mostly imaginary and vastly overblown threats, while the REAL threat, the merchants feeding you this fear and paranoia, drag us further into the dark?

Standing at a podium and mourning the murders of schoolchildren is only a starting point. The rally I went to in Kansas City had every single speaker mention voting. When we marched, some of the chants we shouted were reminding people to vote.Motivating people to take action is a big part of this, and it's working. That's why the right is so scared right now.

I was aware of the original version, yet I didn't read this as satire but rather as fake news. Now, if this were drawn as an editorial cartoon a genre we're almost universally familiar with, then we'd quickly categorize it as satire. We know what to expect with the genre. But, who expects a CGI'ed imagevideo to be used for satirical purposes? Few, I imagine. And this speaks to other genres, like satirical news TV programs. Some people took The Colbert Report as being a comedic, yet earnest right-wing news show making fun of liberals. There was no significant difference between the groups in thinking Colbert was funny, but conservatives were more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely meant what he said while liberals were more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements. httpjournals.sagepub.comdoiabs10.11771940161208330904So consider the genre and the audiences familiarity with that genre before claiming others should immediately recognize this as satire . . . if it were ever meant as satire in the first place which would take knowing the creator's intention.",32,crowdsourced,2018-03-27T13:02:59Z,,0.19,0.16,0.14,0.17,0.18,0.16

8a9xwl,,"This number is patently false. As has been pointed out in this thread and elsewhere, this is the same set of bastardized statistics from the Gun Violence Archive that was reposted from HuffPo two weeks ago. It was wrong then and it's no less wrong now. The GVA counts four dead teens in a Brooklyn familial homicide even though only one teenager was killed. Four people died in total, but not four teens. And one was the murderer himself. Another counts a dead 17-year old man who died during an attempted armed robbery, a felony, and was shot dead by his would-be victim. It's sad the guy was stupid enough to try his luck and get killed, but he died during the commission of an armed felony and he was stopped by a law-abiding gun owner who may have very well saved his own life by using his own gun in legal, justified self-defense. Lumping him in to inflate a statistic for a political motivation is why people don't trust news and can't think critically. If you comb through the stats from GVA, you'll find the same disturbing trend. Calling a grown, adult criminal who willingly robbed someone at gunpoint and died as a result of a self-defense shooting a ""teenager killed by gun violence"" is patently dishonest and in bad faith.I posted a quick breakdown of some of these stats in a previous thread, back when HuffPo cited the same number from GVA two weeks ago.

March 13, 2018 Midland, MI - A 16 y.o. kid with a history of mental issues steals a gun and then engages police in a shootout. He had made off-hand remarks to his own family about his desire to commit suicide by police.4. March 9, 2018 Fredricksburg, VA - after stealing a car and a .45 caliber handgun, a juvenile suspect was killed in a shootout with police after they responded to multiple reports of burglary and drive-by shootings5. March 9, 2018 Kansas City, MO - A victim is killed in a drive-by shooting with no age given, but this is still counted among the 73 teen deaths6. March 5, 2018 St. Louis, MO - a 17 y.o. kid committed suicide in the bathroom of his high school7. March 5, 2018 Kissimmee, FL - a 39 y.o. woman kills her 17 y.o. daughter and then kills herself8. March 14, 2018 NYC, NY - 4 people are found dead in a likely triple-murder suicide by a 27 y.o. man. Among the dead is a 16 y.o.9. March 4, 2018 Durham, NC - 17 y.o. man is killed when he and a friend attempted to rob another man at gunpoint and he is shot and killed. The shooter was cleared of all charges as the shooting was deemed to be in justified self-defense.10. March 3, 2018 Cherry Valley, IL - two boys, a 14 y.o. and a 12 y.o. are killed in a double-murder suicide by their father in their home. This is counted as three teen deaths, despite the fact that the third death was the father.11. February 28, 2018 Rankin County, MS - a 23 y.o. man kills two female acquaintances, a 17 y.o. and an 18 y.o. over a ""card game""12.

February 26, 2018 Fresno, CA - a 21 y.o. man is killed when his car exchanges fire with another car in what police suspect is a ""gang-related"" incident Again, this is counted as a teen death.14. February 26, 2018 Arlington, TX - a teenager is injured when a 46 y.o. woman shoots herself in the chest15. February 26, 2018 Converse, TX - A 17 y.o. is shot in the front seat when an acquaintance in the backseat attempts to take a ""package"" from him. Police are unsure if drugs were being exchanged, but marijuana was found in the car.16. February 25, 2018 Jackson Twp, OH - a 16 y.o. and a 17 y.o. are shot in a possible murder-suicide17. February 23, 2018 St. Louis, MO - a 15 y.o. is killed by his father in a double-murder suicide. This is counted as three teen deaths. 18. February 25, 2018 - McComb, MS - a 13 y.o. boy commits suicide19. February 24, 2018 Jackson, TN - a juvenile who had escaped from juvenile custody and had an arrest warrant for criminal impersonation kills another teenager after illegally acquiring a firearm20.

8a9xwl,,"However, I do not see a need for high-capacity, assault-type weapons to be made available to the general public.I understand your comment and the meaning behind it. I do have to ask, is this really such a huge problem that we need drastic change to fix? What percentage of the US population are killed by ""high capacity assault-type weapons? each year? What percentage are killed by handguns?If you wanted to save the most lives, you'd be advocating for the removal of handguns instead of ""high capacity assault-type weapons."" Or, even the removal of swimming pools, since they kill more people in the US than AR-15s.But, it's not about logic, is it? It's about emotion. Large capacity assault-type weapons are scary, and your movement is based on fear, not on logic, so you go after what scares you the most, rather than what is actually the most impacting.If you want to ban ""scary looking guns,"" and you get the majority of legislators to agree with you, you'll prevent the use of AR-15 type weapons from taking about 100 lives per year. We can't know if those same lives will simply be taken by Glock 19s or Colt M1911s, instead, though. Opportunity costs notwithstanding, it's very possible that you won't save a single life, just shift which weapon is used to commit the homicides.If you manage to make every single privately owned firearm in the US illegal, you'll likely save a few thousand lives. Out of the 33,000 lives that are lost using the firearm as a tool, 20,000 of those being suicides, maybe a third would live instead. That's a worthy goal but at what cost?Switching to AI driven cars will save as many, or more, by making it ilegal to drive one's car. No more distracted driving, no more lives lost to drunk driving. Worthy goal, right?Making it illegal to self-administer pharmacueticals would save twice as many, since prescription drug abuse kills many more people than high capacity assault-type weapons do. Are you writing your legislators about this? Are you marching to take away our rights to handle dangerous drugs? why not, if you want to save lives?

Even if the FMR didn't apply, it's still likely going to be first-degree because the intent to kill the witness is still there. What the FMR does is it transfers the intent to commit the felony to any consequence of their felonious conduct in this case, murder.Your example is still accurate. If the surviving robber were to escape and hold out for a while, the only murder they could be charged with would be their accomplice's.

You could get stuck in a ditch in a rural area and have someone stop to offer to attach a winch to pull you out or otherwise check on you in no time. But in a different context where they're watching TV at home they'll have no empathy at all for their enemy liberals, even if they're just kids.I have a deeply conservative aunt who will go to Maldova every year on her own dime to help a desperately poor orphanage. She along with my uncle adopted 4 kids from a very troubled home and did their best to raise them to adulthood the oldest is only at the mental level of about a 5 year old due to terrible neglect by her birth parents and still lives with them. They can both be some of the nicest, most compassionate people I know and the least empathetic at other times. It boggles my mind. It's like Jekyll and Hyde.I don't think it's just American conservatives. If a set of people fall into your 'enemy' group, empathy can drop off a cliff even if you're an otherwise nice, intelligent person. We have to each be constantly vigilant to not let that happen on a personal level. Otherwise you can start throwing them all together and let your antipathy towards all of them grow which definitely won't lead to anything good.

7xz9ja,,"I've been reading about gun laws in the Czech Republic, and it sounds like really sensible measures to protect gun ownership while also making it a highly regulated process. .To own a gun at all - you have to pass a written exam, practical exam, medical evaluation, psych evaluation, and a criminal background check. Everyone has the right to have guns, but you have to meet all the criteria first. All guns are marked, registered, and you bear a degree of responsibility for accident or misuse.And there are different tiers of permit granted depending on what criteria you meet, and what your needs are. A- firearms collection B- sport shooting C- hunting D- profession E- self defenseYou have to provide a case for needing a gun for whatever kind of permit you're applying for, self defense being the highest degree of ownership..I'm gun owner myself, carry concealed most of the time, and a supporter of the right to bear arms.But there needs to be rules for this stuff, lots of rules. And from what I'm reading about the Czechs, sounds like they're doing a lot of things right. They're an example of a country with plenty of legal gun ownership, but statistically low gun violence considering that they don't practice a complete ban on private ownership.",29,Catshit-Dogfart,2018-02-16T17:27:00Z,,0.20,0.11,0.29,0.06,0.18,0.16
7xz9ja,,"You will obviously get rage filled pushback at the mere thought of giving up weapons, as clearly a Bill of Rights written in the late 1700s gives everyone the ""natural right"" to own guns. Times are different now, and while I do agree with the right to bear arms, I believe it is a right that should be highly respected and earned, and not just a blanket free for all. I'm willing to agree with you though. Guns do not get treated with the respect they deserve. Anyone who fully understands the life altering power a gun has, should also understand the need for stricter and deeper background checks when purchased. No one is taking away their rights, no one is denying their due process, no one is coming to their house and taking their currently owned weapons. All we want to do is make the process of obtaining a gun carry the weight and gravity equivalent to the power and importance of owning that gun.Everyone talks about gun restriction laws taking away their 2nd amendment rights. They seem to conveniently forget that at some point their 2nd amendment right begins to infringe of my right to life, liberty and the persuit of happiness. So which comes first?

It is very obvious that the majority of these 17 ""school shootings"" were nothing of the sort, and the writer is pulling shit out his ass to pad his article.

Anyone with a history of mental illness, in which the illness can cause violent or irrational behavior, or anyone currently on psych meds that have side effects that can cause violent, irrational behavior, should automatically be disqualified from gun ownership.I also have no problem with slightly more rigorous testing, both written, and physical demonstration of firearm knowledge and safety, before being able to own a gun.Lastly, in a related debate, banning ""semiautomatic assault weapons"" does not make any sense. For those of you who are not knowledgeable of firearms, this would still leave equally as powerful weapons on the shelves. Example the ruger mini 14. A hunting and ""ranch rifle"". Literally the only differences between that and the dreaded s AR15, are some plastic parts, hand grips, and small parts that attach to the end of the barrel. None of which affect the ""deadliness"" of the gun. They shoot the same caliber round, at the same velocity, with a difference of only fractions of a second in how quickly each round can be fired.

8dqfgi,,"You said my guns were more important to me then saving kids lives so that would imply that I actually own a gun wouldn't it?All you did was list a bunch of laws from other countries. What does that have to do with America? Please outline a policy that would work in America to reduce mass shootings andor the murder rate that doesn't violate the 2nd amendment. If you want to talk about straight up banning guns, that's a completely different conversation.Yes, mass shootings all but ended in Australia after they took their guns but it's not exactly like they had a lot of them before that. Not to mention the violent crime rate went up in both Australia and the UK after they banned guns. So if your goal here is to save lives, banning guns doesn't do much of anything. Evidenced by the fact that Britain now has a knife problem to the point that the London mayor wants to ban knives.See, you're starting from a point of misunderstanding of gun owners. A gun is a tool for self-defense. A way to protect yourself and your family from harm. You want to take the right to defend your life away from people. The main basic right of every creature on this planet. What's someone supposed to do against someone who breaks into your house and is trying to hurt you or your family? Call the cops and hope for the best? Do you really trust the cops to protect you and your family? They don't even have a constitutional obligation to protect you. The only person you can count on to protect your life is yourself and I refuse to force people to outsource that job to the government. Remember, law enforcement are the people who repeatedly failed the kids of Parkland High and allowed that murderer to carry out his plans. These are the people were supposed to trust our lives to? The way that Sheriff Israel went on TV and refused to take responsibility while blaming the NRA was disgusting. Their incompetence and lack of action caused the deaths of those children, not the NRA. This idea that the NRA controls Congress is ridiculous considering the fact that the amount of money they give them is miniscule compared to other groups. The NRA gets its power from gun owners and pro-gun congressman are pro-gun because of their constituents, not the NRA.

8dqfgi,,"Well, if you look at the list of mass shootings and massacres in Australia they don't have a separate page of school shootings like America does, hmm, I wonder why that could be, you'll see that since they enacted their gun control laws after the Port Arthur Massacre, there have been 14 mass shootingsmassacres. If you look at America's page of only school shootings, you'll see there have been 17 incidents since the beginning of 2018 alone, including one today the 20th. Now, I don't claim to be a math teacher, but I'm fairly certain 14 incidents over the period of 22 years is much less than 17 over a period of 4 months. But I'll let you do the math for yourself, just in case you want to check over it. Please show me in the constitution where the govt is given the power to limit the peoples rights to own guns.One, it's the government's job to protect its people, so if the people are being senselessly murdered, the government is supposed to step in and protect them. Second, that's a goofy argument that can be taken very far out of context pretty easily. The Constitution also doesn't say you shouldn't murder children in schools, so why bother doing anything about it? Just let those kids be murdered, right? Of course, even if you could find that clause Id still have the right to own a gun simply as an extension of my ownership of my body and my property.""Prove me wrong. And even if you do, I'm still right, because I say so."" Nobody denies that you should own guns, the idea that the government wants to take away all your guns is a phantom illusion that Fox News and the NRA have planted in your heads. Literally the only thing that the left wants, is for the right to stop screaming and having a tantrum and come to the table so that the talks can start on what should be done to prevent the murders of children. Nobody will get everything they want, but a compromise can be reached, but compromise onky works when both sides sit and talk.

Automatics would be a real pain and require about what they do now. Pistols would require a permit and yearly or twice yearly training and safety classes.

Because I moved down pretty nicely, pretty quickly, and we had bullets flying right over my head after I went down. So Im glad I went down.

They saved the two, and they were really hit tough, both of them equally.Elon Musk 0545Yeah.Donald Trump 0545And my first question was, because I heard bullets flying over me and I said, How many people were killed? Because we had a massive crowd there, a tremendous, thousands and thousands of people. And there was no land. It was all people. So I said, How many people have been killed? Because I knew there were other shots being fired. And they said, We dont know yet, but some people have been badly hurt.

Unfortunately, the reality is that many departments are understaffed, especially in those areas that they are needed most, and they have to make tough calls on where to go when.The second is we don't want officer's actions constantly guided by the fear of lawsuit. When responding to a dangerous situation, we don't want the officer to act on a fear of potentially being sued if he or she makes the ""wrong"" decision. Instead, it should be based on their training and analysis of the situation at hand and free from external distraction.Of course there are going to be outlier cases where these two concerns don't seem to play a role.

I'll be god damned if there's shots going off or an active shooter and I'm not one of the first guys through that door. That's what we fucking live for. That's part of why I signed up for this job and that's what you should expect of us.Sure that deputy may never get punished for his dereliction of duty but I hope he never wears a badge again in his life. He doesn't deserve it. There are plenty who have died trying to protect innocent people from evil and he disrespected each and every one of them. People died because he was scared.

Military bases have a lot of guns in vaults, but aside from Military Police, people typically aren't allowed to carry guns. Only in 2016 did the Pentagon permit military personnel to carry private sidearms, subject to the approval of their Commanding Officer.EditMilitary bases have more GGWGs than most other places, but in the context of the GGWG theory, they don't have that many more. As many people have pointed out, one shooter can do a ton of damage even if the GGWGs respond to it right away. At Ford Hood, Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and injured 32 more in 10 minutes, even though nearby police responded to it right away, because the GGWG response time on a military base is not meaningfully different than the response time in most civilian settings.True believers in the GGWG theory would say that every law-abiding citizen should have guns, so that the response time is immediate. So the argument thatthe GGWG theory is dumb because military bases have more GGWGs yet still suffer from shootingswould not convince them. They would say that, if only everyone at Ford Hood was armed, Hasan would've been stopped before he did much damage.To be clear, I am not one of those true believers in the GGWG theory. I think it would be completely insane and impossible to equip everyone with guns the rational thing to do is to restrict everyone's access to guns.I was just pointing out thata saying military bases have more GGWGs isn't really a valid counter-argument to the GGWG theory, since the GGWG theory demands almost-universal possession of guns by good guys, not just a few moreb the average military personnel is not allowed to carry guns, in case civilians who read that comment think they are.",1351,deleted,2018-02-23T12:53:38Z,,0.15,0.12,0.23,0.14,0.18,0.18

Constable Son was stationed at the front entrance when he spotted the man entering with a concealed rifle. The constable lunged to gain control of the firearm, but it discharged and struck him in the leg. Drawn to the Rotunda by the noise, Corporal Malo and Constable Thom took cover and exchanged several rounds with the gunman after he entered the building. Constable Létourneau tracked the gunman down the Hall of Honour toward the Library of Parliament and fired at him several times. RCMP Sergeant Rozon, Corporal Daigle and constables Barrett, Bergeron, Bubelis, Célestin, Fraser, Marcoux, Palmer, Ruest and Waye, who had assembled outside the Peace Tower, entered the Centre Block. Supported by their colleagues, Sergeant Rozon, Corporal Daigle and constables Barrett and Fraser assumed a tactical formation IARD as they charged down the Hall of Honour. With the shooter now cornered in an alcove leading to the Library, Sergeant-at-Arms Vickers, after being advised of the shooters location, dove to the floor in front of him and fired his weapon.

Keep in mind, this place was about the size of a football field and had only about a 6 foot wall for a perimeter. I was in a small makeshift wooden building on the side of the FOB, unable to see outside at the time. The explosion and following report from the small arms fire was so out-of-the-blue for me, even in a combat zone, that I didn't even realize we had been attacked until well after it was over. It's difficult to describe what I thought it was at the time, like a generator had exploded and the automatic fire was reverberating metal from the force of it or something. At any rate, I was trained to use my weapon, which was always in ""amber"" status on that FOB, full magazine, but bolt forward with no round in the chamber but I was not ready to even recognize the threat, much less respond to it. To say that any teacher would be able to react in a cool manner and neutralize a threat in a learning environment where such a change in the environment would shock the system in such a way as to render someone almost incapable of moving is ridiculous.

7zn6x0,,"There's an absurd scene in tombstone where Wyatt earp under heavy fire has had enough and while he and his fellow fighters are pinned down he storms up and marches out into the middle of standing water no less and yells in slow motion ""nooo"" and single handedly turns the fight and shoots many bad guys including the main villain.Absurd but it actually happened at least according to those who were there. Historians recount that what made Wyatt earp special wasn't that he was some fast on the draw gunslinger like you see in the movies but rather he had this incredibly rare ability to remain calm in a gun fight. It was this that gave him a distinct advantage. Even out in the open and in more than one shootout Wyatt Earp was able to calmly take aim and fire upon his opponents. His opponents maybe seeking cover just didn't usually have the same nerves. So even at close distances they'd miss or shoot more haphazardly. That's what made him a legend. I guess having balls of steel.But Earp was a complete outlier in his ability to remain calm. Even others who had experienced shootouts couldn't just stand out in the open and calmly take aim as bullets whizzed past them. And that's the truth with all of humanity. Most of us have this fear of dying and inherently dangerous situations. Some like Earp can place it out of their mind and do the job they need to. No amount of training can prepare one I don't think to overcome these instincts. They can lessen them to some degree but people are only human.I think most studies have shown when confronted with an armed assailant even those who are armed themselves tend to react instinctively to either take cover or flee. Many and perhaps most don't even think about returning fire. Many don't even consider that they might have the possibility. That's because it's pure instinct kicking in to survive and in such situations most don't think or plan out their actions. On top of that most don't have the time to react if they wanted when surprised by an assailant. Even if they did remain calm and reach for their weapon they're often too late. The person planning on killing others by surprise has a very distinct advantage. Add to that most also won't shoot very well because they're acting defensively and too nervous and you have a very uneven gunfight.That being said guns carried by people have saved lives in the past. An armed teacher might stop a killer short of killing more. But that teacher might shoot other by mistake. That teacher my accidentally shoot another not during a killing spree. That gun might get stolen. That gun might cause all forms of terrible trauma. It's a stupid idea that what we need are more guns. The one thing we seem to know for sure is that the more guns there are floating around in society the more people get hurt or die from them. In fact when the settlers first started crossing over to the west they'd heard terrible stories about native Americans and armed themselves to the tit. There were far more deaths from settlers accidentally shooting themselves crossing the country than anything that ever came close to an attack from a native American tribe. Guns are dangerous we don't need more of them.And so knowing the inherent danger excess guns pose to society that's why men like Wyatt Earp would ask those who were armed to turn over their guns while in town. That's what he was doing in the gunfight at the O.K. corral, attempting at first to disarm the cowboys.",26,trivial,2018-02-23T13:00:37Z,,0.18,0.14,0.16,0.16,0.20,0.16

First of all, policing is a profession for some and a lifestyle for others. I don't think anyone becomes a police officer thinking that they won't go -and get that shooter, but many don't. I ran past officers into the building and they were seriously frozen in fear. They couldn't get out of a sentence or process what was happening. Some of these guys were badass officers on the street. For me, everything felt fake. Even as I was stepping over bodies looking for the one or more gunmen, it felt like a super realistic training scenario. It was loud but I couldn't hear anything. Every corner I took I could've been killed, but it just didn't seem real. I wasn't thinking about my wife or my family, just looking for the shooter. That is something that not everyone can turn on and off and frankly unsettling looking back. I knew i needed to go in. I couldn't let my coworkers down and I couldn't let the people inside down. When I first went inside i made peace with the fact that this was probably it and that's the last I thought about it. I couldn't have lived with myself if I didn't go in and this shooting didn't even involve kids. That would've been way tougher. I don't blame this officer for not going in. You go in to that building expecting to die. You follow the sound of the gunshots right into the fight. He probably has a better gun and more ammo.

Ive always known this. Ive always heard this discussed in groups of like minded individuals who carry for self defense. To hear the NRA now use this idea shows me what Ive always known, the NRA doesnt represent responsible gun owners. They represent gun manufactures and it just so happens their interests align with gun owners. Arming teachers, while at the surface, can appear like a good idea to prevent this violence, its not. To properly increase the odds of a teacher or school staff of successfully navigating the confusion of an active shooter situation, would require training, more training then what Im sure would be provided. This isnt something that can be trained for once a year. You need to run drills constantly until its muscle memory and you react properly like its instinct and even then, you can still get it wrong.

Putting yourself in a position to defend yourself and those around you, but don't go looking for trouble is a reasonable response.I agree that arming teachers on the surface seems like an easy solution, but is only treating the symptoms of the larger problem.

7zn6x0,,"There's a pretty interesting Twitter thread being circulated on this whole thing just don't visit the blog linked in the user descriptionhttpstwitter.comTheLastRefuge2status966854507744374784Quoting 1. Watch this video. People don't understand how Broward County School Sheriff Officers operate. I'll explain.2. I spent about 18 months in 2012, 2013 and 2014 investigating Broward and Miami-Dade school policies and how those policies transfer to law enforcement practices.3. My interest was initially accidental. I discovered an untold story of massive scale and consequence as a result of initial research into Trayvon Martin and his High School life.4. What I stumbled upon was a Broward County law enforcement system in a state of conflict. The Broward County School Board and District Superintendent, entered into a political agreement with Broward County Law enforcement officials to stop arresting students for crimes.5. The motive was simple. The school system administrators wanted to ""improve their statistics"" and gain state and federal grant money for improvements therein.6. So police officials, the very highest officials of law enforcement Sheriff and Police Chiefs, entered into a plan.7. As soon as Miami-Dade began to receive the benefits political and financial from the scheme, Broward County joined on. The approach in Broward was identical as the approach in Miami-Dade.8. It's important to remember, this was not an arbitrary change - this was a well-planned fundamental shift in the entire dynamic of how teenagers would be treated when they engaged in criminal conduct.9. The primary problem was the policy conflicted with laws and over time the policy began to create outcomes where illegal behavior by students was essentially unchecked by law enforcement.10. Initially the police were excusing misdemeanor behaviors. However, it didn't take long until felonies, even violent felonies armed robberies, assaults and worse were being excused.11. The need to continue lowering the arrests year-over-year meant that increasingly more severe unlawful behavior had to be ignored. Over time even the most severe of unlawful conduct was being filtered by responding police.12. We found out about it, when six cops blew the whistle on severe criminal conduct they were being instructed to hide. The sheriff and police Chiefs were telling street cops and school cops to ignore ever worsening criminal conduct.13. The police were in a bind. They were encountering evidence of criminal conduct and yet they had to hide the conduct. There were examples of burglary and robbery where the police had to hide the recovered evidence in order to let the kids get away without reports.14. The police would take the stolen merchandise and intentionally falsify police records to record stolen merchandise as if they just found it on the side of the road.15. They put drugs and stolen merchandise in bags, and sent it to storage rooms in the police department. Never assigning the recovery to criminal conduct. Stolen merchandise was just sitting in storage rooms gathering dust.16. They couldn't get the stuff back to the victim because that would mean the police would have to explain how they took custody of it. So they just hid it. To prove this was happening one of the officers told me where to look, and who the victim was.17. At first I didn't believe them. However, after getting information from detectives, cross referencing police reports, and looking at the ""found merchandise"", I realized they were telling the truth.18. A massive internal investigation took place and the results were buried. Participating in the cover-up were people in the media who were connected to the entire political apparatus.19. The sheriff and police chief could always deny the violent acts assaults, rapes, beatings etc. were being ignored that's why the good guys in the police dept gave the evidence of the stolen merchandise. That physical evidence couldn't be ignored and proved the scheme.20. From 2012 though 2018 it only got worse. In Broward and Miami-Dade it is almost impossible for a student to get arrested. The staff within the upper levels of LEO keep track of arrests and when a certain number is reached all else is excused.And it continues.

7zn6x0,,"At the Alexandria Congressional baseball shooting last year the shooter opened fire but two officers, Davie Bailey and Crystal Griner armed with only pistols and in a terribly open position were able to save countless lives simply by providing return fire to pin him down. It seems in these situations the best response is to provide any kind of armed resistance, it doesn't have to be a SWAT team. While I disagree with the idea of arming teachers I think that police policy needs to be updated to reflect the fact that often these shooters are not looking for a firefight and will often kill themselves or hunker down when engaged. It is unfortunate that this police officer failed when the time came, he is only human after all, but I don't think I can ignore that he could have likely saved many lives if he had taken literally any action. The myth that he was worthless against a AR-15 with a pistol is proven false with the Arlington case.",27,Rajjahrw,2018-02-23T13:35:55Z,,0.10,0.11,0.22,0.16,0.19,0.21

The army has no farms. The army has no factories. The army has no fuel refineries. Abroad, the US Army is a huge threat because they have a continent's worth of resources and manpower to just pour onto the situation. In the US mainland, every city they bomb is now not only hundreds of thousands of citizens they have to provide for, but also hundreds of millions of dollars per year in taxes they're not getting.Additionally, in the logistical nightmare event of a homeland oppression situation, they cannot force me to go to work with a drone or tank.

Whereas most gun free zones are not controlled environments, this one will be packed with guards, metal detectors, etc. In such a controlled environment, making sure the USSS knows the identity of every carrier IS the safest situation for the Vice President.However, a gun free zone with no guards or metal detectors is extremely unsafe for the VP.

In that case, no metal detectors, uncontrolled environment, no guards it would actually be SAFER to allow LTC-carrying citizens to carry.

ALL firearms must have their firing pins removed and they are inspected to verify this, and ammo is absolutely prohibited as a safety measure because you have thousands of people handling each firearm, and if you allowed live guns and ammo you would be creating an increased risk of a negligent accidental shooting.The concern is not that someone would take a firearm in to commit a crime, it is just to reduce the risk of an accident in an environment where people are extensively handling firearms rather than simply having them holstered all day. Most gun shows have the same rules, as well as gun stores and ranges.At the range I used to run, our rule was that firearms could be brought in completely unloaded and in a case, and had to be inspected by a staff member to verify, or they could be brought in carried concealed, in which they had to remain absolutely concealed and in their holster until you were in a bay on the range. If someone holstered in a gun for gunsmith service, we would take them into the range, have them remove and clear it there, before letting them return to the store.",5,dancingferret,2018-04-29T19:18:31Z,,0.15,0.18,0.19,0.12,0.18,0.17

Named after Republican assemblyman Don Mulford, the bill was crafted in response to members of the Black Panther Party who were conducting armed patrols of Oakland neighborhoods while they were conducting what would later be termed copwatching.1 They garnered national attention after the Black Panthers marched bearing arms upon the California State Capitol to protest the bill.234 AB-1591 was authored by Don Mulford R from Oakland, John T. Knox D from Richmond, Walter J. Karabian D from Monterey Park, Alan Sieroty D from Los Angeles, and William M. Ketchum R from Bakersfield,5 it passed both Assembly controlled by Democrats 4238 and Senate split 2020 and was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan on July 28. The law banned the carrying of loaded weapons in public. 6 Both Republicans and Democrats in California supported increased gun control. Governor Ronald Reagan, who was coincidentally present on the capitol lawn when the protesters arrived, later commented that he saw ""no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons"" and that guns were a ""ridiculous way to solve problems that have to be solved among people of good will.""

The video is something to give them something, anything, that they could plausibly use to justify their disparaging statements.The goal isn't truth, the goal is to fightdisparage the people they perceive as their opponents. One of the most effective ways to disparage your opponent is to try and frame your opponents strengths as a weakness. So in the case of the survivors of a school shooting, the alt right try to frame them as being responsible for a school shooting. They're trying to undercut the legitimacy of their opponents.It makes a lot more sense if you think of it as two warring armies rather than people having a discussion. The members of the side launching the attack only care if it's damaging and effective and hurting their opponent.

87v1t4,,"Side note One of the links inside the article is to a really good article from The Atlantic, written by a 13-year radiologist in a busy nearby Florida trauma center, on how radically different the AR-15 gunshot wounds are from the typical handgun wound she sees In a typical handgun injury, which I diagnose almost daily, a bullet leaves a laceration through an organ such as the liver. To a radiologist, it appears as a linear, thin, gray bullet track through the organ. There may be bleeding and some bullet fragments. I was looking at a CT scan of one of the mass-shooting victims from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who had been brought to the trauma center during my call shift. The organ looked like an overripe melon smashed by a sledgehammer, and was bleeding extensively. How could a gunshot wound have caused this much damage? The reaction in the emergency room was the same. One of the trauma surgeons opened a young victim in the operating room, and found only shreds of the organ that had been hit by a bullet from an AR-15, a semiautomatic rifle that delivers a devastatingly lethal, high-velocity bullet to the victim. Nothing was left to repairand utterly, devastatingly, nothing could be done to fix the problem. The injury was fatal.... I have seen a handful of AR-15 injuries in my career. Years ago I saw one from a man shot in the back by a SWAT team. The injury along the path of the bullet from an AR-15 is vastly different from a low-velocity handgun injury. The bullet from an AR-15 passes through the body like a cigarette boat traveling at maximum speed through a tiny canal. The tissue next to the bullet is elasticmoving away from the bullet like waves of water displaced by the boatand then returns and settles back. This process is called cavitation it leaves the displaced tissue damaged or killed. The high-velocity bullet causes a swath of tissue damage that extends several inches from its path. It does not have to actually hit an artery to damage it and cause catastrophic bleeding. Exit wounds can be the size of an orange. With an AR-15, the shooter does not have to be particularly accurate. The victim does not have to be unlucky. If a victim takes a direct hit to the liver from an AR-15, the damage is far graver than that of a simple handgun-shot injury. Handgun injuries to the liver are generally survivable unless the bullet hits the main blood supply to the liver. An AR-15 bullet wound to the middle of the liver would cause so much bleeding that the patient would likely never make it to the trauma center to receive our care.... As a doctor, I feel I have a duty to inform the public of what I have learned as I have observed these wounds and cared for these patients. Its clear to me that AR-15 and other high-velocity weapons, especially when outfitted with a high-capacity magazine, have no place in a civilians gun cabinet.",429,JuDGe3690,2018-03-28T21:34:49Z,,0.14,0.17,0.18,0.17,0.16,0.17

They have been in continuous meltdown ever since.Hypocrisy aside, it's a good indication of the political threat they perceive from the post-Parkland gun control movement. The long-term prospects for the extremist views of movement conservatives on gun regulation do not look good....The best Republicans can offer is stuff like what former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum proffered over the weekend learn CPR instead of ""looking to someone else to solve their problems.""For one thing, it's deeply telling that in reality, a hypothetical elementary school combat medic trying to save their homeroom classmates from grapefruit-sized high-velocity rifle wounds would be most concerned with staunching bleeding, not CPR. Conservatives can't even get their transparently bad faith deflection arguments right.And that is why they are largely reduced to smearing and defaming a bunch of kids trying to participate in American democracy. It's the only political move they have left.But more importantly, by refusing to accept even slight compromise in the gun debate, conservatives have made their position extremely brittle. After Parkland, public opinion has shifted fast in favor of commonsense regulations like universal background checks, a national gun registry, and reversing the ban on government-funded gun violence research. Meanwhile, fanatical anti-Democrat partisanship from the NRA is purging out the last vestiges of pro-gun sentiment from that party. If and when Republicans lose their grip on national power, new gun control measures are liable to go much further than they would have if the NRA and Republicans had accepted a tactical retreat.It will serve them right.",49,The-Autarkh,2018-03-28T20:07:26Z,,0.09,0.24,0.18,0.15,0.14,0.21

They ARE making the debate less civil. These teenagers are calling the opposing side ""child murderers"". Guys like David Hogg are putting up price tags conflating the deaths of school children with the money Marco Rubio gets from the NRA. It's beyond ridiculous.Because the teenagers hyperbolically suggest that the NRA is basically fine with clockwork massacres of schoolchildren, if the alternative is modest regulation of gun manufacturers or restrictions on gun purchases.By ""modest"" gun regulation you mean outright banning large swaths of firearms? And the focus is on rifles. If your end goal is to save lives, rifles account for about 3 of firearm murders. Four times as many people are killed with knives as they are with rifles. It makes ZERO sense to start your gun control push with rifles. That's part of the reason the pro-gun side is so critical of these teenagers and the gun control crowd in general.

85kk0s,,"Do you actually want the answer, or are you asking rhetorically?If it's the former, it's honestly pretty simple. Your conception of how military force works is mistaken. For quick reference - I served two tours in Afghanistan in an infantry battalion in the sticks. I have long-term experience being a member of a modern military trying to put down a determined insurgency fought by poorly-armed partisans. I only mention that because I don't want you to think I'm talking out of my ass here, I did this professionally and have studied it pretty extensively both in the military and out.Here's where you're going wrong You imagine the military as being united during a civil war.This is a major factor, and understandably, it's a mistake a lot of people make. You're used to thinking of the military as a unified block representing the government's legitimized use of violence. In the event of a civil war, however, the military would not remain united. I cannot possibly emphasize enough how much the average infantryman would resist orders to even so much as confiscate arms from the civilian populace, much less forcibly occupy their cities. You have to understand - the people who plan on fighting back in the event of tyranny are the people whose kids serve and who've served themselves. The combat arms branches are overwhelmingly southern working-class who trust the government a hell of a lot less than you do. Yes, that is bizarre and contradictory, given their profession. The American infantryman is a complex animal, outside his love of strong drink and obscenity. Think about what happened in Syria part of the military stayed loyal to the state, part actively joined the resistance, part deserted and went to guard their own homes, and part stayed in to work as saboteurs. Thinking a civil war would be military vs. civilian is a false premise it would not be. You drastically overestimate the effects of a technological advantage.This is usually the crux of the argument. ""What can your AR-15 do against a drone?"" Nothing, of course. If the government wanted to smash every populated area in the US into dust, they could do it and it would be hard to stop them. That, of course, would also lose them the war as another major power would immediately step in to our shattered shell of a country and set up shop. You can't win wars by bombing, full stop. In my second deployment we shot literally tens of thousands of artillery rounds and dropped thousands of tons of bombs, and this was in a rural area where we had complete command of the air and high ground. We killed plenty of insurgents. Unfortunately, killing insurgents is about eighth on the priority list of ""things we need to do to win a COIN war."" It's often actively detrimental because when you kill a guy who has eighteen fighting-age cousins, a few of them are going to join right up in his place. We're never going to win there. We can drop five times more bombs every day all day for the next ten years and not a thing will change. Boots on the ground are mandatory for occupation. Check it out, man - we fought people who were armed with ancient Enfields and improvised explosives. Your average gun-owner in the US is at least as well armed as any given Talib and many are much, much better and well-trained on top of that. It is basically impossible to crush an insurgency by force unless you're all right with simply leveling the place. If the government wants to win a civil war, it can't level the place by definition. You're ignoring the advantages of the ""other side.""There are a hell of a lot more veterans than there are active military, and to reiterate, the majority of active military would desert at least and likely outright defect. I am telling you from personal experience - a hundred million armed people are far more than enough to stop ""the might of the most powerful military in the world."" Far more. The difficulty alone in convincing US troops to engage American civilians on American soil on behalf of the federal government...

Yablonsky estimated that there were 200,000 full-time hippies in the United States who were both conspicuously identifiable as hippies and had dropped out of mainstream society. In addition, Yablonsky estimated that there were another 200,000 teenyboppers, part-time hippies, and ""weekend hippies"" who might go to high school, college, or a ""straight"" day job, but participated in hippie culture on an occasional basis.

85kk0s,,"I'm sure this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but if we want meaningful and effective gun legislation, we have to start by acknowledging that in some regards, the NRA members are right. In the hands of a responsible and well educated person in the realm of guns, a gun is not a danger to others accidental shootings happen, and I will address those later.The easiest way to fix the issue of gun violence in America would be to take away all the guns. If there are no guns, you can't shoot people, and by making them so scarce it becomes very hard for criminals to get their hands on them and commit crimes with them. But we shouldn't pass legislation because it's easy, we should pass legislation because it's effective and right and fair to all our citizens. Taking away all the guns is not fair to responsible gun owners. We need legislation that still allows the right people to own guns, and stops the wrong people from gaining access to them. We also need legislation that helps stop people looking to commit suicide from gaining access to firearms to easily, because that costs us a lot of lives every year. With that in mind, what kind of legislation could we implement to achieve these goals? We could start by mandating that to purchase a firearm, you have to gain a license. To gain this license, you would have to pass a test, similar to a driving test, that requires you show knowledge of gun safety, gun handling and that you have a gun safe with enough storage space to house all your firearms. You would be required to keep a tally of all your firearms at your home and on your person when you are carrying the firearms so you can properly report it to law enforcement should a firearm be lost or stolen from you. Edit Following another reditor's suggestion, in order to ensure ease of access to all people regardless of background, we can provide a program to facilitate transportation to the facilities where this testing would be done. You would also have to pass a psychological evaluation. A series of questions designed to establish your mental health, and a number of sessions with a therapist to ensure that you're not a danger to yourself and others. You would be required to attend sessions with a therapist on a regular basis maybe once a year, but let's not get hung up on specifics to ensure your continued good mental health. I also happen to believe this would be beneficial to society as a whole if more people saw a therapist, but that's another issue entirely. In the spirit of the second amendment's well regulated militia, you would be required to attend on a regular basis maybe every 6 months, maybe every year, but again let's not get hung up on specifics a training camp with other gun owners in your local area. During that time, you would go over gun safety, gun handling and marksmanship with other like minded individuals. This would help create a sense of community and give people in that community a chance to evaluate other gun owners in the area, and perhaps surface concerns about the ability of a person to properly handle their guns, their character or their mental health. A little bit of self regulation might help avoid some disasters. All of this would be financed by taxes on guns. Of course, there will still be accidents, and their will still be people that will slip through the cracks and commit horrible actions. That is an unfortunate side effect of allowing people to own guns, but people die in plenty of other leisure activities, and accidents happen every day. We cannot stop all of them from happening, but I believe with proper legislation we can still allow gun owners to own the guns they want, and protect most people from the kind of horrible acts we've seen.",7,Edril,2018-03-19T18:06:26Z,,0.16,0.14,0.22,0.16,0.17,0.15

85kk0s,,"Well, what your typed seems reasonable. But history shows that these are just used to deny the right. ""We could start by mandating that to purchase a firearm you have to gain a license.""Please read this and see how anti gun politicians go out of their way to try and prevent you from exercising your right. httpswww.washingtontimes.comblogguns2011oct5miller-emily-gets-her-gun She went through the hoops... You can see they just tried everything to make it difficult. And places like San Diego have made it so you can't exercise a right, unless you are politically connected.... Same with NY. In fact, I think there was just an arrest made in NY about a guy ""selling"" access to gun permits. ""You would also have to pass a psychological evaluation.""Well, for starters... Good luck finding a mental health professional to sign off on this. One of my hobbies is skydiving. This has been brought up as part of a screening for students.... You know how many mental health professionals were willing to sign that a guy was OK to jump? All you need to do is ask pilots about the FAA medical process and get their opinion on it to know why this will not work. Next, you know that Cruz PASSED a mental health screen... Right? You know that the Pulse shooter was investigated and passed... Right? You know that the Fort Lauderdale Airport shooter tried to turn himself in... Right? The Isla Vista shooter was in therapy and the police were sent ot check him out, he passed. The Fort Hood shooter was KNOWN to have issues with his co-workers who were all mental health professionals. I could go on and on and on. ""In the spirit of the second amendment's well regulated militia, you would be required to attend on a regular basis""The Supreme Court has ruled that it is an individual right unconnected to service in a militia Heller, 2008. The militia cause gave A reason, not the reason. For example, they didn't mention hunting because that was as common as going to grocery stores today. It didn't need to be mentioned as a reason. The militia was controversial still is and that is why it was mentioned by name. And the Constitution Bill of Right's actually mentioned this in the 9th Amendment ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.""So just because hunting was not mentioned... Does not mean it is not protected. What would actually save lives is looking at the actual situations. For example, why didn't the FBI act on Cruz? When the Fort Lauderdale shooter turned himself in, why didn't the FBI do anything? When the Pulse shooter was under FBI investigation, why did the FBI not find anything? Why did the Dark Knight shooter not get Baker acted? One very specific thing would be to put a temporary ban on ownership for people kicked out of school for behavioral problems. One thing I noticed, and that made me respond to you, is that you had ideas, but ALL of your solutions made innocent people who want to exercise a right jump through a bunch of hoops. I am not for rules that target and inconvenience 99 of the population when there are actually easy options that will target those who ave shown through their ACTIONS that they should lose a right. Example... Drunk driving is a problem. I would NOT suggest that every car in the US have interlock devices. That would be putting obstacles and costs onto innocent people who have done nothing wrong. I AM fine with crushing people who get DUI's. This is what lowered DUI deaths in the 80's. Don't get me wrong, interlock devices on ALL cars would save more lives... But is that something you would support? And the VAST majority 61 of ""gun deaths"" are suicides. Out of the 34000 number thrown around, about 21000 are suicides. I don't blame the rope when someone hangs themselves, I also don't blame a firearm. So that leaves 10-12K deaths. The majority of those are related to crime. And we have a VERY long history of not punishing criminals who use guns. Google ""Byron Champ"". He is a felon that was caught with a gun... Know what sentence he was given? About 8 months of boot camp... Not prison, boot camp. When he got out of boot camp, he was later involved in a gang shooting in a park. But please, don't take my word for it, look it up for yourself. You want to actually stop gun deaths?1. Gun education in schools. Why is it that to prevent DUI's, pregnancy, STD's, drug use..Etc, we claim education is the key, but on guns it is not? 2. Arrest and actually punish criminals who use guns. If you are a violent felon and caught with a firearm... Why would you ever be let out of prison again? You have shown to have zero interest in rehabilitation. 3. When we KNOW a guy has mental issues... Put them in care. The vast majority of mass shooters had KNOWN mental issues. They all expressed violent tendencies, many were kicked out of schools, etc. Why were they not taken seriously. Now, when you do all that, I will gladly look at other options if they don't work. But why should I agree to jump through a bunch of hoops well intended when we don't do anything about criminals and those with mental issues? If I don't reply, well, it is because I get down voted so much here that I can only post once every 9 mins.... And I frankly am not going to try and reply once every 10 mins... too much time out of my life when I know all I am going to get is down voted more.",8,SSMDive,2018-03-19T20:26:38Z,,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17

Also put a minimum draw length and draw poundage on triggers to make rapid semi-automatic fire less accurate by requiring a stronger ""jerk"" on the trigger.

The NYPD has the same high-poundange set up on their pistols, which is why they have events like the 2013 Empire State Building shooting, where a guy shot a coworker on the street, the NYPD responded, fired 16 bullets, and hit 9 ! bystanders. There is no planet where inaccurate gunfire, especially from people who want to defend themselves or othersIn school shooting type scenarios, accuracy at 100 meters doesn't matter when you are armed and unopposed.

Your statement is so generic that it is damn near meaningless. Ban accessories and modifications that improve shooter efficacy, including things that increase the rate of fire bump stocks, doublestrike capabilities, improve handling under high rate of fire and in various positions pistol grip, improve weapon maneuverability verical forward grip, and aid in faster target sighting ACOG, holographic, and powered sights and scopes. Also put a minimum draw length and draw poundage on triggers to make rapid semi-automatic fire less accurate by requiring a stronger ""jerk"" on the trigger. That won't eliminate mass shootings, but could help make them less common and help reduce the casualty count by making less-trained shooters less effective. There is so much bullshit in this.

I suppose you could also mandate reloading systems that require more finesse to use, which would make them tougher to reload in stressful situations. So not only can't we hold guns or aim them, we can't reload them. Also improve mental health services in the US, which are frankly atrocious.I agree. And the economy, the stigma surrounding seeking mental health care even if you don't have any mental illness, promoting education, and a few other things that address the reasons why people turn to violence to solve their issues rather than more reasonable measures.

80fmva,,"So people are just forgetting that Russia is polarizing both sides of contentious issues in Western politics? Yes, that includes the left as well as the right. Yes, that includes everything political from the mainstream to the edgy and fringe like fascism and communism. Good point. They are trying to influence both sides. But one side is 30 times more likely to amplify Russian trolls and bots. One side has been actively undermining ongoing federal investigations into this psychological warfare by the Russians. One side stands by as sanctions to punish this action are not enforced.If we are to do anything to combat this via both passive and active measures, we need to get remove the willfully complicit GOP. I trust the Democrats to do something about it when they take power since obviously the GOP has shown no effort to do anything.",15,yellekc,2018-02-27T00:11:35Z,,0.14,0.13,0.29,0.14,0.16,0.14

Las Vegas shooting coverage was gone in abit under a week and I can't even recall the survivors faces nor stories.What I'm trying to say is, it's putting people off the media because it feels so ""forced"", rather than dipping your toe into the subject, they go straight to saying let's ban all guns and who even needs a gun.A lot of people in my area liked the overall message but sorta tuned out the more it felt forced to go in certain directions. I don't know if this subreddit will downvote me or not, but a lot of people have said it feels like a forced agenda was pushing the kids in certain directions.Most people can't even recall the Florida survivors faces but the the girl and the guy.

80fmva,,"Wasn't the point I was trying to make if you read up on it. I said I think they should have interviewed more survivors from the Las Vegas shooting to draw up to this point. There was a crap ton of people there yet none of them really got interviewed much nor spoke their minds on the subject. I just wish the Las Vegas shooting would of been the turning point for guns as it was more a perfect set-up.I don't even know what any survivors of the Las Vegas shooting look like but that was the worst shooting in history and yet it was dropped quick as hell when it was the perfect time and opportunity for all this discussion. Only difference here is that it was a high school and they had some kids who wished to speak their mind. I never complained this shooting got too much coverage, read my thing once again. The whole point I was making was rather than using the same few faces, why not swarm the media in numbers of people who survived the shooting. Wheter you agree with me or not, there's a good chunk of people who feel it was a huge propaganda effort and using kids to further an agenda. When you use a lot more survivors it's abit more difficult to call it propaganda and it gets the point across on just how many lives were effected by this.Las Vegas was a perfect storm yet the ball was dropped. Just look at Florida gun sales and the article that came out, gun purchases are skyrocketing along with everything gun related.",5,GoFastDoggy,2018-02-26T21:28:05Z,,0.13,0.13,0.26,0.16,0.13,0.18

80fmva,,"However, am I the only one who thinks it's weird how popular the survivors of this shooting have become compared to survivors of previous shootings? I'm sure you're not, but we live in a different time now. The last school shooting to get major attention was Sandy Hook, and there was no way a bunch of grade schoolers were going to be able to speak out like these teens are. Our president is a loudmouth buffoon on twitter. These kids are trying to combat that. I didn't give a shit about anything other than hanging out with my friends and finding ways to be alone so my gf and I could have sex. Politics was no where near the forefront of my brain.I'm 32, but I'll admit that even 3 years ago, I didn't give much thought to politics, only cared about voting for the right people and policies. I was hardly as passionate as I am about it now though. I assume it's the same for these teens. I don't find it wild that they're also arming themselves with more information than teens would have in the past. Have you seen what Teen Vogue has been coming out with lately? They need to be paying more attention to the world around them, and I'm glad that they are. Also, is someone like writing these lines and speeches for them?You're really underestimating them, I can't imagine what it's like to go through a school shooting.
