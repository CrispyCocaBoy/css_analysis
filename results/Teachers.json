I am sure some of the staff had opinions. I never felt unsafe in that school. I knew students that were there when the shooting happened and they weren't afraid for their safety. I also had a 2nd cousin that was a student at Columbine. \n\nI will point out a few things about a nation wide strike idea. In my state teachers are not allowed to be in a union therefore no job protection for walking out. Public School teachers are considered state employees and very few state employees in my state have the ability to form a union for collective bargaining.  I think it is mostly Firefighters that can. Secondly all that is needed to defend the 2nd Amendment is 17 states. You need 34 to pass an amendment. I will point out I know of at least 13 states including Georgia will vote to keep the 2nd Amendment.\n\nInstead of talking gun control lets talk about dealing with the root causes of these shootings. In most cases including the one at my school the shooter was being bullied. We need more mental health counseling in the country period. We need smaller classroom sizes. We absolutely need smaller schools.  My home county has 6 out of 12 non charter or private high schools that are 1500+ students. When I was in high school we didn't have 9th grade on campus simply because the school building could not hold 3000 students. What people aren't talking about is the schools are too big that it is hard to police the root causes of these events. Finally we need to address school funding. This includes teacher pay. Teachers deserve to start out at no less than 50,000 a year.",

One day that week, we talked about gun violence, how it affects our schools/country, and how we can stop it. It certainly wasn‚Äôt the most in-depth discussion, and in hindsight, we didn‚Äôt touch on nearly enough, but it showed me he cared about our concerns enough to address them and let us talk it out.

If even he‚Äôs talking about it, this must be important, right?\n\nHow do you feel about taking a break from your normal subject for a day to educate your students on social issues that affect them?

    "selftext": "This is long. I'm trying to be as concise as possible, but there's a lot that went on.\n\nTL;DR Listen to people when they tell you to keep your head down and your mouth shut.\n\nSo, to give a little bit of context for those outside the US. After the Parkland shooting where 17 students died, Parkland students planned a national protest for students to walk out of school at 10 a.m. If I remember correctly, they were also going to have moment of silence for 17 minutes, one minute for every student who died.\n\nWhen I became aware of the protests, I talked to my 8th graders about it. We discussed why it was happening, what it was about, and what to think about if they decided to participate. I gave students a chance to discuss if they agreed or disagreed with the protests and the reasons it was happening. Overall, it was a very civil discussion, and we moved on.\n\nAs it became closer to the protests, our school sent out a series of emails. One was from some higher up, saying students shouldn't protest. Another said that only high schoolers were allowed to protest. The ACLU sector of my state even sent out letters to all of the Superintendents reminding them that students have the constitutional right to protest. All of this culminated in a meeting with our Principal the day of, during which the 8th grade teachers were told that it was our job to stand in front of the doors and prevent students from walking out.\n\nThis is when I'd had enough.\n\nDuring the meeting I told my Principal, I'm sorry, but I can't do this. She said that's fine, I'll write you up for insubordination. I said I understand, and that's a conversation that we can have later, but I can't do this. She told me there would be no conversation, I would be written up. I told her okay.\n\nI spent a long time considering if I was really willing to do this. If it was a fight I really wanted to have. I called my husband and talked to him about it. We talked about if it was worth the risk of getting fired. I talked to another teacher who I knew was written up and discussed what it meant for my license or my career at the school.\n\nIn the end I decided not to stand by the door. I could not, in good conscience, tell my students that I support their right to protest, and then participate in something that was getting in the way of them doing that. It was hypocritical and I would have no part in it. In addition to that, I was also 7 months pregnant and I did not want to put myself in a situation where I could potentially get hurt.\n\nThe time came and went. I chose to stand in the cafeteria that was designated as a \"safe\" place for the students who left class to protest. I wanted to show them whatever support I could, and the day moved on.\n\nA few days later my Principal calls me into the office and we have our \"discussion.\" The conversation can be summed up in her statement of \"If you can't do what you're told, I don't think this is the profession for you.\" She seemed to take it as a personal offense to her that I wouldn't do what she asked. I tried my best to be respectful, to make it clear that it wasn't her I had a problem with, and that I understood she was doing what was asked of her by the superintendent, but none of that mattered.\n\nSo, at the end of the school year, I go on my maternity leave. The last day of school for teachers was the 25th and I asked my principal if I could come unofficially since I was still on leave just to say hello to everyone before summer break and introduce everyone to the baby. She says that's fine. I go. I talked to everyone. I talk to my principal, tell everyone that I hope they have a good summer and I'll see them next year.\n\nWhen I come home, I get a letter in the mail saying that my contract wasn't renewed.\n\nSome days, I still don't know if I made the right choice. I now have a daughter who has no insurance as of yesterday. I've been unable to find a new job. And we bought a house right before I got the letter. If I could have just done what I was told I wouldn't be in this situation, but I just hate that there's is so much backstabbing in some administrations.\n\nI understand that what I did was insubordination. I understand that there are consequences, but I also feel like the least my principal could have done was tell me that my contract wasn't going to be renewed to give me the chance of finding a new job. There was no need to wait until the very last day of school, and there was no reason she couldn't tell me to my face. And knowing that she's a person who gossips and can't keep a secret, I'm also upset that no one who knew thought to trust me with the secret and tell me my job was gone.\n\nI see a lot of new teachers asking for advice, and a lot of people say to wait until you have tenure to speak up. This kind of situation is why.",

Why were the Freedom Summer murders? Why do we remember the things we remember. Note: I'm not saying this is the same issue (because I know someone will misread this if this post gets any traction). The American Civil Rights movement is just a really good example of this series of starts and stops that seemed to bubble over with change, when really the seeds had been heavily sewn for several decades of relatively little movement on the issues at hand and even plenty of regressions. I think that's where we are now with a lot of things, including this. \n\nEverything in history that changes anything becomes the tip of the iceberg. We don't see the whole thing usually (unless you study it in depth, of course). We see the big moments. And those moments are picked by the collective psyche of mankind in some weird way, by fate sometimes, and they are the moments that generate change. I'm not sure Parkland will become the tip of the iceberg. It may be part of it, but it may take more to get to the truly defining and culminating moment. It's WAY too early to tell. But it feels different, you're right. Why? Because change doesn't happen over night. And it doesn't happen because some politician declares it. Change comes from the people. Right now, these students are participating in activism that appears to be powerful, gaining some traction, etc, and hopefully that continues. Maybe something cuts it short and we wait until something else starts this momentum. I think it's clear now which way the wind is blowing - what's not clear is when, how, or how bad it has to get first. ",

My para and I are BOTH firm with rules, but some of the high schoolers really dislike my para (basically have issues with women giving them directions). One student in particular had a rough year all around with everyone, but particularly her, and eventually ranted about putting a bullet in her brain(this was 3ish days after Parkland). The cops should have been called so much earlier, but that was the last straw, I talked to the SRO, got the ball rolling, student was arrested for terroristic threats, and spent two-ish weeks in jail before being bailed out. I know some staff thought my para and I were over-reacting, and some people were being jerks and passive aggressive about how they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúscared‚Äù blah blah blah, but I‚Äôve stuck by my para and been supportive because no, being EBD doesn‚Äôt mean you can scream about shooting people in the head with no consequences. Dude is 17.\nAnyways, kid made bail, is out, but no court date to determine anything, and he was actually eager to come back to school. Para not ok with that, says she will quit if he comes back (and she is a fabulous para, I love her) understandably, so I worked with ppl and plead our case, and student was put on ‚Äúhome-ish‚Äù bound, in theory to allow him to catch up and focus on his work without students asking him what went on, etc. but there is no court order that says he can‚Äôt come to school.\nso then we came to end of course testing. Para was like ‚Äúwait, what, he has to come in to test?‚Äù Yes, he does, do you want to take those days off, I will make sure there is no contact, but I can tell she is still upset and thinks it is unfair.\nThen today I found out that he is asking if he can participate in some end of the year activities, and he will most likely be coming back next year. Para is livid, saying she still has the ability to take out an order of protection against him and will quit if he comes back to school and will testify in court as to that effect. \nI don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to be supportive and I want her as my para, but this kid has a right to an education, he‚Äôs not incarcerated, he not inpatient, and if Dad really wants to make a fuss he could bring up the fact that we have students who HAVE physically hurt teachers, served time in RYDC, and came back to school. We have mentally ill students who HAVE actually brought weapons ‚Äî including guns ‚Äî to school, and after serving time, have returned to school. I honestly feel that if she pursues the personal protection order, she will be transferred to another school, because a right to FAPE trumps a right to employment and our contracts stipulate that we can be reassigned to another school at any time.\nWhat should I do? Do you think this student SHOULD be allowed back at school? I and FYI, kid has shown absolutely no remorse and is super pissy that we got him in trouble. I will be heartbroken if she leaves, but I can‚Äôt keep fighting this.\nEDITED TO ADD ‚Äî one of the other big stressors is that the other teachers don‚Äôt really think the situation was really that bad, and are irritated about all the extra work we have to do pulling together materials and lesson to be sent home, and the fact that we have to test him separately, etc.",

    "selftext": "Warning: Really, really long story but even shortened there is a lot to explain. \n\nI never thought I would be asking for help on something like this but I need advice on how to frame my time at my last school as I begin to job search again. \n\nI took a job this year at an urban middle school after two years go being a successful elementary school teacher. To put it bluntly, it was the worst mistake of my progressional life. \n\nBesides being out of my element with this new location, grade level and subject matter (am certified, never taught), I shared a classroom with two different teachers for almost six months (with no real divider) as we waited to move into a new building, had no projector or smart board (in a technology heavy 1:1 school), had no support for the fifth of my grade who spoke little to english or was pushed-in from the self-contained class as that was only for tested subjects and was teaching a grade level that had such a high amount of students with behavior issues that it required a meeting in which my principal asked the parents to talk to their kids because after over 800 write-ups in five months they didn't know what to do anymore.\n\nI struggled in a way I never struggled before. I did everything you could imagine to make my lessons the best they could be and manage the behaviors in my classroom. I worked a minimum of 70 hours a week. I also observed other teachers, asked for help often and tried every strategy I could but because of these issues that I now admit were out of control and also kept changing (every time I felt I had a handle on things a new policy or school setup changed), my classes became more and more out of control.\n\nIn response, I was a burnt out mess. I was having multiple nervous breakdowns a week, had a terrible stress-induced crohns's flare up that lasted over a month and would burst into tears multiple times a week (not in front of students but co-workers and administrators which I think only happened twice before that and it was only to teachers I was friends with). I prayed that I would someone leave this job.\n\nI ended up getting my wish in the worst way possible.\n\nOne day in class the students were working on a choice board project. This was one of rougher classes with a lot of challenging students including one who was determined to disrupt the class in whatever way he could. The student who I will called Zee would yell, run around my class, play on his computer with the sound all the way on and tell other students to stop working because my class was stupid and didn't matter. I did every possible consequence in my power but his behavior continued to worsen.\n\nI was helping a student with something when I overhead another student say the Zee was talking about bombings and how a muslim student in my class could help him. I didn't hear a lot but I did say I was going to follow up and write-up the behavior. I wrote up the fact that racist comments were made that next morning but what Zee said about bombings didn't really hit me until I hit send on my write-up. I barely heard how Zee was talking about bombing school but this was literally a few days after the Parkland shooting occurred. On one hand, Zee said crazy stuff all the time (although nothing about weapons and bombs) but it always was to just get a reaction. He was disruptive but ultimately he was a 12 year-old boy who wanted attention. But I kept thinking what if it was something this time. I would never forgive myself if I said nothing and I put my students' lives in danger. \n\nSo when my supervisor popped his head in my class I asked to talk to him and explain what I thought I heard in class. I was expecting him to thank me and find the student to talk to him. We never talked about what happened in Parkland and how to respond to a situation like this. And teaching only elementary, this never was an issue before.\n\nInstead, he got very angry at me and asked why I didn't tell him this sooner. Taken aback I said how I told him as soon as I remembered and also with Zee he tended to say intense and disruptive things all the time and you had to take things with him with a grain of salt. But when I realized the next day the what what he said could mean, I got him right away.\n\nMy supervisor tried to find Zee but he wasn't in school that day so a full investigation was done to see if the claims were real or not. Everyone was involved and they even his house was searched. Nothing was found, Zee was just talking crap to look cool and annoy the muslim student who he was fighting with that week.\n\nDespite it all being okay, my principal finds me during lunch and tells me that because of what happened I should talk to my union rep and see them after school. I am in shock and terrified because this is the last thing I expected to happen. I find of the reps and immediately begin crying My amazing rep, once she heard the whole story, first told me my work conditions were terrible and should have talked to her sooner. And in response to the incident, she assured me that I wouldn't get fired but would probably get a write up in my personnel file and reprimanded. The timing wasn't good but I didn't do it on purpose and I was as timely as I could possibly be considering I forgot about the main comment.\n\nOne part was right. It was put in my personnel file. But I was told I made a gross misjudgment because I should have hit the red button and asked for a supervisor right away. But because of my classes being as chaotic as they were I didn't and put hundreds of lives in danger. Because of that I was fired but I had the option to resign in order to control my narrative. If allowed myself to be fired I would have to work 60 more days but if i resigned I would stop working as soon as I sent the letter. \n\nMy rep was surprised and shocked at how that went but explained that treatment like this was not a new thing. I asked her what to do and she said I should resign. After the way I was treated I do not owe them any more work, and knowing me I could still get a job in childcare to support myself. So I resigned but surprisingly enough I left on really good terms with my principal and administration? They all wished me luck in finding a better matched school and my supervisor offered to write me a reference letter explaining the goods things they can say if they are asked and that I left the school on good terms.\n\nI got a job as a nanny and was planning on applying later in the year but found out there is a big teacher job fair coming up. There will be 29 districts including first district I ever worked at and this district is nice enough to not need job fairs to recruit so I'm super excited. I was loved at this district (but it being a leave replacement it was only temporary) and loved working there. I really want to impress them again and return and in normal circumstances, I probably would have. But here are my worries and the questions I need answers to.\n\n1. How the heck do I explain why I left? I'm not going to mention the incident (unless they see my file and ask) but my resume still says I left mid-year and I know how bad that looks.  On one hand, I don't want to look like a complainer talking about how horrible my last school was. But on the other hand, I want people to understand that my situation was not typical. If I left, it was for a damn good reason so just because I didn't want to work to fix things. So if I am asked what happened, what do I say?  Can I convey how terrible the school was without actually saying how terrible the school was?\n\n2. Do people actually check your personnel file? I was told it barely happens but it must happen sometimes. And it's going to say a little bit about the incident. So is there a way to explain that?\n\nThank you in advance to all help!",
