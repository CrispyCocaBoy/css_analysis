So, it is worth noting that the era of school shooting *begins* during the strictest period of firearms law in the United States.\n\nIn 2004, the Assault Weapons Ban lapsed to much wailing and gnashing of teeth or applause and celebration depending on political leaning.\n\nNothing happens.\n\nNo, seriously. *Nothing happens.* The FBI collects and tracks crime data in the Uniform Crime Report. Over the years, you will see a trend beginning in the late 1980’s of violence beginning to decrease that continues through until today. The AWB came and went, and there is nary a bump in the trend line to signal its existence. Violence, of any type, neither improved nor worsened relative to a slow decay experienced by almost the entire developed world.\n\nCalifornia, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, and several other states and individual cities enact legislation to control the type and use of firearms within their jurisdictions in response to the lapse of the Assault Weapons Bans or the ebb and flow of political tides.\n\nNothing happens.\n\nIn several states, Constitutional Carry passes, enabling citizens without criminal records to bear arms in public without individual licensure.\n\nNothing happens.\n\nConcealed Carry Reciprocity passes, forming a network of states that each recognize each other’s license, allowing those with out-of-state licenses to bear arms in public.\n\nNothing happens.\n\nBump stocks and binary triggers appear, each purporting to increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic firearms.\n\nNothing happens.\n\nAn executive order is released to ban bump stocks under the assumption that they increase lethality.\n\nNothing happens.\n\nThe problems we have today absolutely were problems 20 or 30 years ago, and we haven’t been ignoring them, either. We’ve simply been chasing ineffective solutions.\n\nEdit: I should also mention that several major universities now allow their students to bear arms on campus, a change that was met with the sound of thundering crickets.",
