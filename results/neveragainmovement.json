Does you being a veteran mean you get more of a say than someone who didn’t serve?\n\nNobody is getting run over at the polls on either side. Both groups are firmly entrenched and vote in bloc. That means the likeliest outcome is continued gridlock. If you want to have an actual conversation, you have to be open to equally-valid, opposite points-of-view. I’ll begin:\n\nYes, we have a violence problem in society. This is not necessarily unique to America, though. In terms of overall deaths, firearm homicides are curiously low when you consider how many there are in circulation. What I think we probably agree on is the disturbing use of violence by unhinged persons. Where I genuinely struggle to identify long-term solutions that specifically address this problem is in balancing the protections afforded for our Rights and freedoms with the possibility of serving society by legally barring unstable persons from not just firearms, but all types of violence that is at their disposal. In my mind, the conversation goes down the road of how do we address individuals prone to violence WHILE protecting the Rights of all Americans, including those we are concerned about because of their history of violence...\n\nAny solution that will address this concern needs to also respect the protection of Rights and liberties that we are all endowed with. So, while I agree that it can sound frustrating to hear that your proposed solutions are unacceptable to many in society because they do not adequately consider the aforementioned Rights and liberties, this is actually pretty typical of the idea-forming process. We all have to be willing to throw ideas at the wall without getting insulted when our ideas don’t bear fruit because they failed to meet all the necessary criteria. The truth is that if there were an easy solution, we would have already found it. \n\nSo, if you’re willing, I’m open to an actual conversation.

In any conversation or discussion where we limit ourselves to only one option, we imply that our mind is made up and the discussion is over. I’m hoping that isn’t the case here. \n\nPerhaps I’m reading tone into your parting comment, but it feels rather biting for the sort of conversation I was trying to engender. I offered my puzzlement to the problem and was curious about ideas for addressing violence. \n\nThe idea you did offer doesn’t work for me—and presumably others—who are not willing to budge on infringement of any of our Rights or liberties. Still, we should try and discuss the problem from the perspective of identifying a mutually-agreeable solution. I’m wondering what sorts of mental health supports we could implement to address violence from the perspective of long-term solutions. My premise is that we didn’t create violent individuals overnight, so it’s unlikely we will solve the problem in short order either. In terms of firearms legislation, as I read through your comments, it sounds like most of the ideas you’ve presented already exist in one form or another. As such, perhaps the breakdown in our communication is in the enforcement or oversight of those laws and statutes. Without going down the road of enacting new legislation per se, what are your thoughts about creating a better communication/enforcement/oversight network to use the existing laws to both keep firearms from prohibited persons AND to respond to those individuals who—in one form or another—were clear ‘red flags’ that should have been picked up along the way, a la Nick Cruz?\n\nIn my mind, this is the first step that will provide us with the most return.

The Courts do not amend the Constitution, nor *re*-interpret it 'for modern times'. The fact that such belief is tolerated in our judiciary is itself a sign and essence of our collapse as a Constitutional Republic.\n\n&gt;First off, no we are not. That's why the nation is actively having a discussion about which weapons to allow ownership of and which to restrict. \n\nFirst, the nation isn't really having a discussion. A lot of authoritarians, unconcerned with actually understanding the issue themselves, are following the directions of their Authority figures (mostly far-left University intelligentsia, and The State itself) to march, backed by the overwhelming blast of *absurd* propaganda (just look at this OP for a perfect example) from the monolithic state-approved MSM.\n\nSecond, the single most universal demand of these authority figures is far-reaching bans of all the most common firearms in the country today, which if done, will render the Second Amendment *obviated*. Recognizing this fact (and what it might mean for the ability of any such laws to actually be put into effect), many are very openly calling for the formal repeal of the Second Amendment itself.\n\n&gt;Some weapons are already restricted, you do realize that correct? Bombs, chemical weapons, etc. We're just adding new weapons to that list for clear reasons.\n\nYes, and these restrictions are legally structured not as straightforward prohibitions, but as prohibitively high taxes, which, later, they decided to stop accepting any payment of (or, in some cases, straight-up 'emergency power' executive order martial law). All Federal Gun Control is structured this way by necessity, in order to pass them through the gaping loophole (grant of absolute authority) of the 16th Amendment personal income tax. They are still illegal on their face, because the Constitutional *proscription* outweighs the *power*. This is just the only way they have any slight whiff of legal plausibility (a whiff for if you're physically or perceptionally blind).\n\n&gt;The amendment actually says \"A well regulated militia, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nYou fucked up the actual letter of it and the interpretation. I'm not going to bother arguing this, because it was NEVER ACTUALLY A SINCERE ARGUMENT. The purpose of the 'militia' clause was specifically to contextualize the \"ARMS\" that it is \"THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR\" as *weapons of war*. Go read US V Miller, the first ever SCOTUS gun control case for the first ever national gun control law, circa 1938/1934 respectively.\n\n&gt;Also remember when this was written, arms meant musket and cannon fire. \n\nAnd rifles, pistols both rifles and unrifled, volley-guns, bombs ('torpedoes'), blades and maces, and war-ships with many cannons which could destroy cities. And probably other things only remembered in history books. And all of these things, the state of the art weaponry of the time, were owned by private, non-state-agent Citizens at the time - which is precisely what the Second Amendment set out to protect.\n\n&gt;We've progressed in technology as a society and the founding fathers could not have forseen the weapons we create today when writing this law. \n\nNo, this is either a disingenuous or extremely ignorant argument. Firearms such as are being discussed are fundamentally similar to arms of the time, and certainly nothing that couldn't have been imagined. This argument might have been a good thing to have, at the dawn of the 20th century, when we were watching the advent of aircraft and aerial bombing. Instead we suffered a terrible silent coup (1913), and have lived under a quiet, insidious tyranny ever since. It's gone too far and it's time for it to fucking stop, and for us to take back our  rightful places as CITIZENS OF A FREE STATE. Not 'civilian population' of a *secure* (and yet paradoxically in a state of perpetual crisis) one.",

    "selftext": "Hello. My name is Jesse Young. I don't post much on Reddit but I had something I needed to share.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g11qzhp_1M\n\nI live next to Parkland, FL. My wife teaches at an elementary school only a couple of blocks away from Stoneman Douglas. When the shooting happened both her and my daughter were on lockdown because the shooter was missing and within walking distance of their school.\n\nA lot of the MSD students are former students of my wife's school, including a few that died. This event has hit very close to home for everyone in this community. We all know people affected by it.\n\nLast month we were watching the March for Our Lives and I grabbed my guitar and this song came out. This isn't a political song. I don't know what the solution is to fix all this school violence, but I know something needs to change. I've been inspired by the students of MSD who have decided to take action into their own hands and make a difference. So this song is for them as my way of saying thank you and to keep fighting.\n\nI hope when my kids (7 &amp; 2) go to Douglas, they won't have to worry the way kids do right now. And that parents won't worry like they do now. The problem will never go away but we can do better.\n\nThis song is really for anyone who sees something that needs change. YOU CAN be the voice or the person to make it so. Stand up, fight for what you believe and never give up.\n\nThank you to anyone who is trying to make a positive difference in people's lives. This world needs as much positivity as it can get.\n\nThank you for taking the time to listen to this song. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nJesse\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g11qzhp_1M",
