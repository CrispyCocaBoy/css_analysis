    "selftext": "Serial killers are often terrifying, but if there is one thing notable, is that the 1960s - 1990s were the golden years for serial killers. I mean, just look at some of the times serial killers worked:\n\nTed Bundy, 1974-1978.\n\nJohn Wayne Gacy, 1972-1978.\n\nGary Ridgway, 1982-1998. (though could have lasted till 2001)\n\nDennis Rader, 1974-1991. \n\nJeffrey Dahmer, 1978-1991\n\nZodiac Killer, 1968-1969. (though could have been 1966-1971)\n\nUnless your a serial killer nerd, you couldn't really remember any serial killer from 2000s or 2010s, I mean, we have the West Mesa Bone Collector (2001-2005), the Long Island Serial Killer (1996-2010)...but there isn't anymore. Now, let's look at some infamous Mass Murderers.\n\nEric Harris and Dylan Klebold, 1999, Columbine Massacre.\n\nAdam Lanza, 2012, Sandy Hook Shooting.\n\nJames Holmes, 2012, Arizona Theater Shooting.\n\nNikolas Cruz, 2018, Parkland Shooting.\n\nSeung-Hui Chio, 2013, Virginia Tech Shooting.\n\nAmy Bishop Anderson, 2010, Alabama University Shooting.\n\nStephen Paddock , 2017, Vegas Music Festival Shooting.\n\nAnd many more. As you can see, many of them happened in the 2010s, with only the Columbine Massacre (which hit its 22 year mark yesterday), which occurred in 1999. Really, in the golden years for serial killers, Mass Murderers didn't seem to be that far. Whilst there were some shootings, it seems that in the 2010s, mass murderers hit there peak. Especially against Schools. So why this happened? Well, it is actually quite simple. The main reason why the Zodiac killer wasn't caught was mainly because people didn't pay that attention, and the killers were slick in every move. However, I feel like now, police are more cautionary. As you know, in my Peter Manfredonia post, I said that the police knew that since he was traveling to different states, they knew the investigation would slow down. They ended up catching him because they used an uber tracking device. Since the police know more, I feel like that what really decreased the serial killer age. Plus, remember Joseph DeAngelo, the Golden State Killer? He was caught in 2018 just because of a DNA TEST. But how does this explain the rise in mass murderers? Well, it is clear that it would be hard to spot one. Barley anyone could have predicted the Columbine Massacre, or the Parkland Shooting, because there wasn't any bad signs. And it would have been impossible to stop Adam Lanza or James Holmes from entering the places before it was to late. So, what do you think? Why did the serial killers disappear? Why more mass shootings? Comment below!",

It's not too long before those people are convinced. \n\nAnd the point of mass murder isn't to get away with it, it's the crime itself.

They’re either smart enough to not get caught or get caught with modern technology at under 3 victims before they can escalate. The more I’ve researched, there’s tons of pretty horrific or sexually motivated murderers but they don’t get as much attention because they only have one or two victims. No doubt they would have continued, just never got the chance. Not to mention in the 70s I think the commonplace of hitchhiking definitely played a part in accessible victims. \n\nMass shootings interest me because it’s a very different psychological pathology than serial killers but still based in just as much violence. I would almost go as far as to say mass shooters are more narcissistic than serial killers. Of course there’s a multitude of “reasons” and variables but SKs seem to be based on compulsion and sexual motivation vs. mass shooters who feel they have somehow been wronged and are acting out of hatred or disdain. It’s more of making a big statement on their perceived societal or personal grievances. Guns are more common place now in American society and gives mass shooters a way to ramp up the death toll as high as possible which is what they’re going for. I don’t think society drives a mass shooter to commit a mass shooting, I don’t blame video games, etc etc etc but society has changed radically in the past 40/50 years and I think it’s an adaptation to the times for violence unfortunately.",

Mr. Cruz, now 23, pleaded guilty to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder last month. He is scheduled to go on trial early next year. A jury will decide if he faces capital punishment or life imprisonment.\n\n“Although the financial details of the agreement are presently confidential, it is an historic settlement and the culmination of the Parkland families’ long and arduous efforts toward truth and accountability,” the law firm representing the families, Podhurst Orseck, said in a statement.\n\nThe Justice Department said in court papers that it was in the process of completing a settlement, without disclosing the amount. Two people familiar with the case said it would total about $130 million, though the precise number could change before the final agreement.\n\nThe revelation that the F.B.I. had received information about the gunman ahead of the shooting devastated victims’ families and the Parkland community in the days immediately following the shooting. Fred Guttenberg was picking out a casket for his 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, two days after the shooting when he got an urgent call from an F.B.I. agent working with the families. The agent delivered the difficult news.\n“Are you telling me that if the F.B.I. did not make a mistake and did their job a month sooner, my daughter would still be alive today?” Mr. Guttenberg asked the agent, according to the lawsuit Mr. Guttenberg and the 39 other families eventually filed against the bureau.\n\nI’m afraid so, sir,” the agent replied, according to Mr. Guttenberg.\nThe first tip had come five months before the shooting, in September 2017, when a bail bondsman in Mississippi reported that a commentator with the user name “nikolas cruz” had left a disturbing message on his YouTube channel: “Im going to be a professional school shooter,” it read. Two F.B.I. agents interviewed the bondsman about the comment but found no particular information linking it to a specific person and closed the inquiry the following month.\n\nThe second tip came on Jan. 5, 2018, from a woman who called the F.B.I.’s tip line and gave the bureau information about Mr. Cruz’s social media accounts and troubled family life and school record. She mentioned that he had posted photos of The case had been scheduled to go to trial in January 2022. In its court filing on Monday, the Justice Department asked the court for a stay of all upcoming hearings and deadlines pending completion of the settlement.\n\n“Once those details are finalized and approval is granted, the plaintiffs will ask that the court dismiss these actions in their entirety,” the Justice Department filing said.\n\n* FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The families of most of those killed and wounded in the 2018 Florida high school massacre announced Monday have reached a multi-million dollar settlement with the federal government over the FBI’s failure to stop the gunman even though it had received information he intended to attack.\n\nAttorneys for 16 of the 17 killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and some of those wounded said they have reached a monetary settlement with the government over the FBI’s failure to investigate a tip it received about a month before the massacre. The 17th family chose not to sue.\n\nThe attorneys said the settlement’s details are confidential, but a person familiar with the deal said the government will pay the families $127.5 million overall. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the amount.\n\n“It has been an honor to represent the Parkland families who, through their immeasurable grief, have devoted themselves to making the world a safer place,” their lead attorney, Kristina Infante, said in a statement. “Although no resolution could ever restore what the Parkland families lost, this settlement marks an important step toward justice.”\n\nAndrew Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter Meadow died in the shooting, commended the FBI for accepting responsibility for its inaction, comparing it to the Broward County school district and sheriff’s office, the school security staff and the psychologists who treated the shooter.

    "selftext": "A lot of people were talking about the Columbine fangirl last week and the revelation that, if she were found, it was unlikely the police would be able to arrest her. Although she had made threatening comments, seemed to be planning an attack, and legally purchased a gun, what laws had she broken? \n\nThe U.S. courts have long wrestled with such challenges: at what point does planning a crime become a crime? At what point does planning constitute a prosecutable \"attempted\" crime? Is there such a thing as a ‘thought crime’ in U.S. law?\n\nI was surprised to search the name ‘Jack Sawyer’ and find nothing in this or related threads, as this case is a fascination of mine. Here is his story, and how it changed the way one state handles pre-crimes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Jack Sawyer**\n\nJack Sawyer was an 18-year-old from Poultney, Vermont. He had struggled throughout his adolescence, and during his sophomore year in 2016, he left Fair Haven Union High School. His parents eventually soon sent him to Ironwood, a residential mental health treatment facility and school for troubled teens in Maine. His parents hoped Ironwood could provide their son more comprehensive treatment for his anxiety and depression. In February 2018, Sawyer returned to Vermont. \n\nOn February 14, 2018, Vermont State Police received information about a credible threat to Fair Haven Union High School and contacted Fair Haven Police to track down Sawyer. FHP located and questioned Sawyer, who admitted he used to have a problem with the school, but said he was over it. In the course of the conversation, he mentioned he had recently purchased a shotgun in Vermont after returning from Maine. Although concerned, the police had no probable cause to take further action. \n\nThe next day, the Dutchess County (New York) sheriff’s office contacted the FHP to state that a friend of Sawyer’s had reported that she had received troubling messages from Sawyer over text and Facebook. The Parkland, FL, shooting had just occurred, which Sawyer praised as “fantastic.” He described school shootings as “natural selection” and noted, “Just a few days ago I was still plotting on shooting up my old high school so it’s not like I really wanted a future anyways.” \n\nBased on this tip, FHP detained and interviewed Sawyer again. In this interview, Sawyer admitted that he had been planning to commit a mass shooting at the school and told the police the following:\n\n\\--He had converted money to bitcoin and was searching the dark web for a handgun, but his bitcoin devalued, so he couldn’t purchase it yet.\n\n\\--He said he needed to go to the school to observe what the School Resource Officer’s schedule and patterns were, so that he could make plans to neutralize this threat and prevent the shooting from being interrupted.\n\n\\--He said he wanted to shoot up the school on April 20, the anniversary of Columbine. He had obtained a school schedule, however, and after discovering school wouldn’t be in session that day, he had decided on March 14 instead.\n\n\\--He was planning on wearing camo rather than the trenchcoats like the Columbine shooters.\n\n\\--He said he planned on ending the shooting in the school library as further homage to Columbine.\n\nWhile Sawyer was being interviewed, police searched his father’s house and his car. At the father’s house the father handed over a copy of a book about Columbine and a sawed-off shotgun belonging to his son. In Sawyer’s car, they found a shotgun, 17 rounds of ammunition, four books about school shootings, and, perhaps most chilling, his journal. The front cover read, “The Journal of an Active Shooter.” The journal was filled with suicidal ideation and specific plans for carrying out the shooting, such as a list of needed equipment. An entry dated November 29, 2017, reads:\n\n&gt;I’ve had a change in plans. The day will be coming much more sooner than previously thought. I’ve realized the huge importance of being able to kill the kids that I actually know vs. waiting a year or so until they’re all gone. I’m aiming to kill as many as I can and whoever I can, but it’d also be more fun and satisfying to kill a lot of the dumb fucks that I actually went to school with, I know what they’re like and how idiotic they are. With the sudden shift in plans, that also means that I need to prepare and gather supplies quicker. It shouldn’t take too extremely long to buy the guns, but it’ll be difficult to make the bombs since I don’t really have a good place to practice detonating them, but I’ll probably figure it out.\n\nOn December 1, 2017, he contemplated how to neutralize the school resource office, Scott Alkinburgh:\n\n&gt;The biggest thing I'm trying to figure out right now is how can I get as far as I can into the shooting before cops bust me first and shoot me dead. I know that I'm going to have to take officer Scott out first, but what's the best way? I'm thinking that I'll go in a few days prior to scope things out and see if he can typically be found in his office. I'm intending to just blow his f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* head off before he can even draw his gun or think about what's happening, but I can only hope with that one. If he kills me first, all of this will be pointless since I won't make the impact and chaos I plan to create. I don't think it'll be too big of an issue figuring out though. Probably just shooting his head point blank is the best way to go.\n\nIn his last entry before his arrest, dated February 3, 2018, he lamented that he tried to buy a shotgun in Maine after leaving the mental health facility, but was unsuccessful as Maine prohibits sales to those with out-of-state licenses. Instead, he realized he would need to obtain these in Vermont. \n\nBased on his confession and the gathered evidence, Sawyer was arrested. He was charged with four felonies (tied to attempted bodily injury with a deadly weapon, attempted first-degree murder, and two counts of attempted aggravated murder) and held without bail. In the state of Vermont, the latter two charges may be punished by life in prison without the possibility of parole. \n\nProsecutors later added two additional misdemeanor counts (criminal threatening and a weapons charge). The felony counts were eventually dropped, and Sawyer was released on bail in April 2018. \n\n**Legislative Response**\n\nThe Vermont legislature acted quickly, proposing several changes in existing law. Some were skeptical that Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, would support the proposed gun control measures. He stated that the Sawyer case \"jolted me\" and that he would consider any efforts that would help reduce the risk of a mass shooting. The proposed changes included:\n\n1. Background checks for any gun transactions between non-family members\n2. A ban on new sales of extended magazines (&gt;10 rifle rounds, &gt;15 handgun rounds). (Residents can keep existing magazines, and dealers could sell out existing stock.)\n3. The implementation of extreme risk protection orders, which can prevent an individual from purchasing or possessing guns for up to six months. \n\nGovernor Scott signed all three bills in April 2018 before Sawyer was released on bail. In fact, #3 was invoked immediately, and Sawyer was prohibited from having guns for six months (at which time the order can be renewed or allowed to expire).\n\nA final bill approved in 2018 modified an existing domestic terrorism statute to make taking substantial steps towards carrying out an attack or mass killing a crime, regardless of whether the crime occurs (penalty up to 20 years in prison).\n\n**Sawyer’s Fate &amp; the Aftermath**\n\nIn August 2018, Sawyer’s lawyer capitalized on a newly revised youthful offenders statute. Citing evidence on brain development, individuals aged 21 and younger are now eligible to be prosecuted as a youthful offender. Sawyer’s case was thus transferred to family court, where proceedings are confidential. \n\nIn March 2019, it was announced that Sawyer was deemed a youthful offender on the count of carrying a dangerous weapon. Sawyer will be placed in a residential treatment facility until he is 22. Due to confidentiality protections granted in family court, the public will not be informed about Sawyer's treatment or release. \n\nIn the meantime, $4 million worth of grants have been given to Vermont schools to enhance security. Over $400,000 has been spent at Fair Haven Union High School, including card scanners, safety doors, extensive cameras, additional security personnel, and services that monitor students' social media accounts.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources**\n\n[https://vtdigger.org/tag/jack-sawyer/](https://vtdigger.org/tag/jack-sawyer/)\n\nIf you like legal docs, this has details of the case but also interesting examples the court considered when trying to establish what constituted “attempted” murder:\n\n[https://law.justia.com/cases/vermont/supreme-court/2018/2018-105.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/vermont/supreme-court/2018/2018-105.html)\n\nIf you like podcasts. Vermont Public Radio did a five-part podcast about this called *Jolted* (after Gov. Scott's comment): \n\n[https://www.npr.org/podcasts/642455340/j-o-l-t-e-d?t=1555508852705](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/642455340/j-o-l-t-e-d?t=1555508852705)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo many questions...\n\n\\*Do you think Vermont will be able to prosecute individuals who plan attacks, or do you think these will meet First Amendment challenges? \n\n\\*Do you think extreme risk protection orders will stand, or will they be challenged on Second Amendment grounds?\n\n\\*Do you think Sawyer's sentence is appropriate? Do you think he'll receive sufficient treatment and be less of a threat when he is released in a little over 2 years?\n\n\\*What do you think about schools hiring external companies and monitoring students' social media accounts?",

That's literally how the law is written.

Nevertheless, the State respects the Supreme Court’s  authority and is bound by its ruling,” she said in an emailed statement.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  clearest precedent for whether Sawyer’s actions constituted an attempt  under Vermont law is State v. Hurley, a hundred-year-old case in which a  prisoner obtained the tools to saw his way out of jail but never  actually started sawing. The Supreme Court’s decision was that this did  not constitute an attempt at an escape.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The decision was cited in  motions by Sawyer’s defense and state prosecutors during deliberations  before the Rutland Superior criminal court.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Just as the defendant  in Hurley did not commit an attempt to break out of jail based on the  mere possession of the hacksaws to saw through the jail window bars,  defendant in this case took no action so proximate to the commission of  the school shooting as to constitute an attempt,” the justices wrote.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Each of defendant’s actions was a preparatory act, and not an act undertaken in the attempt to commit a crime,” it said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of the ongoing ambiguity and the outcome of this decision, there were subsequent legislative efforts at clarification, although these eventually failed: \n\n[Sawyer Case Reveals Legal Voids in Vermont Law](https://www.wamc.org/post/sawyer-case-reveals-legal-voids-vermont-law)\n\n[House Backs Terrorism Statute Change, Shelves New Attempt Statute](https://vtdigger.org/2018/05/02/house-backs-terrorism-law-change-shelves-new-attempt-statute/)",
