The SRO would then pull out their gun, point it at them, and give commands to put their hands up and get on the ground. If the parent already has the gun out then they will told to drop it.

I give credit to this guy, he could have got in his car and gotten out of the combat zone faster, but he spent precious moments picking the 4 of us up to get us all further away. We descended the stairwell, jumped some fences to get back into the hotel lobby (jumped damn near a dozen fences that night). His car rolls up, he opens all 4 doors to his sedan and asks me \"Can you shoot?\". I tell him I can, I\\'ve taken a handful of pistol courses, done some time out at gun ranges shooting skeet and plinking. I\\'m far from a great shooter but I at the very least have some base knowledge. So I take the gun from him and tell him \"You drive, I\\'ll shoot...\" So that\\'s what we did, he drove.

You default to logical things that will save your life, even if later on you\\'re guilted by others \"why didn\\'t you do X?\" well, it\\'s because at the time it would\\'ve heightened the risk of injury/death, and not avoided it. You\\'re a robot in these moments. It\\'s why women told \"why didn\\'t you fight back?\" when they\\'re raped is wrong and illogical: they didn\\'t, because it would\\'ve likely got them killed by the attacker trying to silence them, instead of brought someone to the rescue. You do what you have to do to *not die*. It isn\\'t a choice in that moment. \\n\\nThen after, the adrenaline wears off, and you really get hit with that shock: you being to tremble and shake, your fingers/tongue go numb, you may experience tunnel vision, and you often experience all the emotions you offset at once. You will cry, you\\'ll get mad, or you\\'ll hyperventilate or all three. The only thing to do is just work through it, hopefully with a friend. While this happens you\\'ll re-live what just happened: you\\'ll experience it again and analyze it in your brain for mistakes, you think \"I should\\'ve done this\" \"why didn\\'t I do this?!\" etc\\n\\nWhen you finally go home after you\\'ve stopped freaking out, you\\'ll go through the entire thing in your mind like you\\'re retroactively critiquing what you\\'ve done for errors, or aspects you missed. You can\\'t control this, it\\'s involuntary. You\\'ll relive it every 15 minutes or so, which occurs like one \"remembers\" something suddenly like a smell or whatever, you just \"remember\" that it happened, forget, and then \"remember\" it again. You may focus on certain things: what the logo on the attacker\\'s t-shirt was, or the smell of a hotdog stand nearby, but then be totally unable to remember what you were holding in your hands or what you were wearing. Others will describe you as \"zoning out\" when you experience this flashback, and then you may even relive a bit of the shock again, ie numb hands or shaking, the emotional feeling of fear, you\\'ll get jumpy, regular things like a photo on your desk or a poster or your pet will scare/frighten you to look at.\\n\\nFor the next week, it\\'ll happen every 10 or so minutes to half an hour. This will impact your life if you work in service or other jobs that require attention. You\\'ll try to forget about it, shake it off and keep going. They say these few days after a trauma is the CRUCIAL time you need to talk about it with a therapist because externalizing these events are the only way to offload this \"debugging\" or \"revision\" you keep doing of the event. You *must talk to someone during the first week* or it\\'ll imprint on your brain and fuck you up for the long term, and might cement \"triggers\" for these flashbacks, and you do not want that.\\n\\nAfter this first week the flashbacks begin to subside. During this time there are triggers that might make you remember it again, you\\'ll think \"oh that reminds me of- oh shit\" and remember it all again. For some people it might be the sound of helecopters or bangs that sound like bullets, for some it might be men who only remotely resemble their rapist, or it might be smells or just anything that\\'d make anyone remember a thing. Sometimes you can\\'t even tell what the hell it is that triggered it and they seem totally unrelated in every way! it\\'s frustrating to not be able to predict what it could be.\\n\\nIt\\'ll take maybe a year or so before the time inbetween flashbacks is so long you don\\'t have to worry about it anymore. Therapy can halve this time, so it\\'s very important to use it. Therapy will help you compartmentalize this \"healing\" process, like giving a computer a way to analyze data and sort it properly versus just dumping a bunch of data in it and leaving it to run it\\'s automatic system on it and hope it winds up in the proper folder. The difference is so huge.\\n\\nAnyway, if you\\'re reading this: please don\\'t make fun of people who have PTSD even if you think what happened wasn\\'t traumatic. You don\\'t get to decide what does and doesn\\'t fuck someone up. It\\'s not funny for them. They\\'re aware their \"trigger\" might be stupid as well, don\\'t prank them by bringing it up. It doesn\\'t \"get them used to it\". They didn\\'t choose any of this.

Over the years I\\'ve cultivated self-awareness and have committed to treatment, even if I don\\'t like it. I waivered a lot at first because my family and friends didn\\'t understand what was going on with me. Not only did I need to cope with my own self-doubt while facing rolling manic and depressive episodes, but my community would be constantly asking things like \"when can I get off medications forever?\" Ignorance breeds self-doubt and non-compliance to treatment, even when others mean well. And largely, as you said, because you can\\'t physically (or via labs) see what is wrong - your brain goes sideways and people may not see physical signs of illness. \\n\\n\\n\\nAs a personal example, about 5 years ago I had the worst manic of my life. After about 6 months of overactive money expenditure, substance abuse, dangeous sexual decisions, and unfettered emotional sensitivity and creativity, I fell into the worst depression of my life. I have been in very dark places but never had suicidal ideation, except for that year. Once my condition was stable, I knew I couldn\\'t play games with bipolar disorder anymore - I would end up addicted to hard drugs, destitute, dead or all of the above. I made treatment of my disorder one of the most important things in my life.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven having my self-awareness and determination, I went into my first manic episode in half a decade last month. At first I was more energetic and talkative, sleeping less and making impulsive decisions. I know my triggers intimately (winter-spring transition, personal stress, using marijuana) and my symptoms (not needing to eat or sleep much, unhinged decision making, talking so much and so fast noone could get a word in). But even though these things are insanely obvious to me when healthy, I was in a fog of frenzied desires. The head of the command center locked all the doors, flipped off all the people trapped inside, and set the fucker on fire.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween determination and fortune I survived my illness long enough to develop my support network. Within 2 days of falling into florid mania (what I like to call wide eyed, white knuckled, uncontrolled insanity) 4 different people told me I was manic again because I beat the warning signs into them over years. I trusted my friends and family, then sought treatment to rapidly stop the runaway train. An imminent disaster that I, even with my knowledge and awareness, would have gladly accepted because nothing matters but the moment when i\\'m ill.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow apply that scenario to a young person who hasn\\'t even solidified their own identity, much less understanding they have a psychiatric disorder or acute symptomology from a traumatic event. And its not like anyone else can see that something is wrong inside. Sometimes your community can tell something is wrong and send you to a counselor or doctor, but often there is no one to initiate treatment but yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo anyone coping with a mental health issue, don\\'t be ashamed of the illness l. And don\\'t over identify with it - a mental illness is part of you, but it doesn\\'t define who you are. Don\\'t ever let external perceptions or self-perception keep you from seeking help and being a better you. And if you\\'re not sure, don\\'t try to diagnose yourself. See a professional - even if nothing is wrong biologically, it helps to talk to a counselor or therapist.\\n\\n\\n\\nMost importantly, forgive yourself. I just went through an episode that SHOULD have not happened at all, fell into the same mistakes I\\'ve always make, and said things that I sincerely regret. But my disorder is something that I deal with, and it makes me feel empowered to successfully live with something so difficult. What I\\'ve just done makes me feel bad, but when an episode takes over, the command center is not active - your actions are heavily influenced by the illness, and you should forgive yourself for the times when you are being controlled by it. My only real regret is that I ignored the obvious warning signs that preceded something I understand very well at this point. But if I move forward with eyes open, I will do better next time.

We have a very easily controlled boarder with the English channel and many other countries with their own boarder control between us and countries with people that would want to illegally bring in weapons. Weapons have historically always been heavily regulated here. And yet we still have gun crime (albeit no recent mass shootings) and terror attacks with bombs, vehicles, acid, and knives. Also keep in mind that the US is around forty times bigger than the UK with a border to match. \\nTo state no other country in the world has this problem is a bit of an oversight. No other western country has a problem to the degree that America does (though again gun crime and the odd mass shootings still happen), but poorer countries have similar rates if not more gun attacks. \\n\\nYou couldn‚Äôt legally give a harsher punishment to someone based on intent (e.g. possessing a weapon) more than a convicted rapist or armed robbers. Im pretty sure over here in the UK it carries a much lighter sentence than what you seem to be suggesting. Here a good chunk of people get away with a fine and having the weapon confiscated/deactivated. You certainly couldn‚Äôt realistically give someone a year per bullet. \\n\\nYou also cant just confiscate the guns. They are private property. You could make it illegal and get people to turn them in, but the American government would have to reimburse the owners the cost of the guns, as well as possible additional costs for things like sentimental value ect.

Trump\\'s base has been adamant about a relatively far-fetched claim, and provided no proof. It is clear this is because they have to slander the survivors of one of the worst school shootings in order to prop up their ideology. We see this with every shooting these days: Las Vegas and Sandy Hook are both met with suspicion, paranoia, and vast numbers of ridiculous, contradicting conspiracy theories. \\n\\nWhy? Because this demographic has become so dependent on the dogma of gun rights, to the complete exclusion of looking at the consequences of these policies, that they cannot reconcile these shootings with their idealistic and unrealistic ideology concerning gun rights and gun control. So this shifts the conversation from whether this kid should have had guns or if the system needs fundamental reform, to the failings of an individual without greater meaning. The reality is that if these kids did bully the shooter, so what? I don\\'t care what the background of a shooters sad sob story is, when you kill 17 kids you made a choice to become a demon, and they should be dealt with the same way we deal with rabid dogs.\\n\\nThe main thing I want to point out is this: There are two competing narratives in today\\'s society, and they are mutually exclusive. The narrative produced by mainstream media is that Trump is a criminal, a conman, and is completely unfit to be president. The narrative produced by \"alternative media\" is that Trump is a infallible hero, an amazing negotiator who simply cannot be beat.Eventually, the events that are yet to come will eliminate one of these two narratives as inaccurate. If and when Trump is convicted for breaking campaign finance laws, and possibly collaborating with the Russians to break United States law for personal benefit, then we will know he is indeed a criminal conman, and an incapable leader, far from the expert 4D chess player that r/The_Donald likes to claim he is. If on the other hand, he is not convicted, then we will know he is not those things. We will see. But the facts of the situation have been slowly building, hinting towards a disturbing narrative of corruption and the breaking of important laws. Every month that goes by there has been admission of more and more contact with Russians. More and more contact with illegal data collection through criminal misuse of private data. More and more inappropriate personal conduct, covered up with inappropriate hush-money from illegal sources. \\n\\nIf the investigation does indeed show he is a criminal, then that will be enough for most people. And despite a vocal population of true Trump believers, it will not be enough to keep him in power and out of jail. And society will finally have a consensus: the alt-right will be seen as delusion, out of touch rubes, conned by a weak man and leader. It won\\'t matter how many links to infowars are cited, or how mad and outraged his supporters are, no-one will listen to them. Or maybe not. But the important part is that these two narratives cannot coexist indefinitely.

As legal gun ownership increases, gun-related deaths decrease, and this trend has been going on for years. States with the strictest gun control laws have higher rates of gun related deaths than states that have more relaxed laws. On top of that, almost every mass shooting has occurred in a \"no gun zone\". It is such a lazy argument to blame guns and ignore other factors. School shootings may be increasing, but the laws have stayed the same for the most part. They are not easier to obtain then they were 20 years ago. This proves that mental health, specifically male mental health, is the main issue here. That is the only variable that has changed so drastically. You want to see school shootings decrease? Try spreading awareness and raising money for men\\'s issues for once. Stop protesting for women\\'s rights (which you already have), and stop pushing the fable of the wage gap.

I just cannot believe how liberal politicians and liberal voters continue to make the same lazy ass argument after every mass shooting.

Harsher enforcement and harsher punishments did not lead to a decrease in drug overdoses or drug related crimes. It actually did the opposite. Why do you think increased gun regulation would be any different? If a mentally disturbed person want to get a gun, they will get one legally, or illegally - and if they can\\'t get a gun, they will figure out another way to cause chaos and destruction. So what if you take the radical measure and ban all guns, and disturbed kids start using their cars to run people over. Are you going to push to ban all cars? What if they start using knives? What if they start watching sketch videos and tutorials on how to build bombs? My point here is that a mentally ill person that has made up their mind to go on a killing spree will find a way, with or without guns. The only way to see mass killings decrease is to prevent people from ever getting to that disturbed mental state, and that has nothing to do with guns, it is all mental health.\\n\\nPlease stop with these knee jerk reactions and stop ignoring the actual cause of gun violence, which is poor mental health.
