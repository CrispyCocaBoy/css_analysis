Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) and Chicago Public Schools officials said Friday.\n\n&gt;Hamline staff followed CPS' established protocols; they kept the ICE agents outside of the school and contacted CPS' Law Department and CPS' Office of Safety and Security for further guidance, according to a statement from a department spokesperson. \n\n&gt;The ICE agents were not allowed into the school and were not permitted to speak to any students or staff.  \n\n&gt;Teaching and learning continued throughout the day at Hamline.",

Chicago Public Schools officials had initially said the agent or agents were from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSecret Service said they were investigating a threat, and responded to a house. They said they were then told the person they wanted to talk to was at Hamline Elementary School, but they did not enter the school, the Secret Service told the I-Team.\n\nThe threat the Secret Service was investigating was not immediately clear.\n\nCPS officials had claimed at least one ICE agent was denied entry to the South Side elementary school Friday morning.\n\nICE said this was not a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement encounter.\n\nThe Hamline Elementary School principal claimed at least one ICE agent arrived at the Back of the Yards school about 11:15 a.m.\n\nThe principal said they followed protocols, and did not allow the agent or agents inside.\n\n\"We will not open our doors for ICE, and we are here to protect our children and make sure they have access to an excellent education,\" principal Natasha Ortega said.\n\nThe school did go on a soft lockdown.\n\nAll students and staff are safe, officials said.\n\n\"CPS will continue to protect our students and their families in alignment with the Illinois TRUST Act and Chicago's Welcoming City Ordinance,\" one school official said.\n\nChicago Teachers Union President Stacy Davis Gates called the situation \"unprecedented\" at a news conference Friday afternoon.\n\nCPS and CTU officials claim ICE agents were denied entry to a school Friday.\n\nCPS and CTU officials emphasized that schools are safe.\n\nCPS does not ask for citizenship status, and will not allow ICE agents inside without a valid judicial warrant.\n\nChicago police said they were not notified of the alleged incident.\n\nThe incident comes amid heightened concerns in the city's immigrant communities after the Trump administration announced that it will pursue targets for deportation at schools.\n\nGloria Marquez has two children at the school, and said she was texted about the incident by another parent, who was working as a classroom aide at the school.\n\n\"Did not give me any details, all she said was 'I was trying to come in to do my job, and it wouldn't open.' So, I guess what happened, she said, 'the kids are in soft lockdown; immigration is outside,'\" Marquez said.\n\nCPS rapid response teams, along with several community groups, descended on the neighborhood.\n\n\"We are united, and schools are a sanctuary of learning,\" said attorney Berto Aguayo, with Increase the Peace Chicago.\n\nFriday afternoon, many people are on edge.",

She also noticed that when her brother would shower Caron would enter the bathroom and lock the door. He'd end up having Caron's child when he was 13 in 2019 and it was only brought to the attention of the police when the kid's father made a facebook post last month about how similar the child looked to his son. Up until then she'd completely gotten away with it. \n\nAccording to the sister his brother admitted to her that he knows he's the father but to keep it a secret. Caron is being held without bond on on charges of aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, and endangering the welfare of a child. The school district have put her on paid administrative leave.",

A much greater predictor is impulse control issues. Turns out most of the time somebody who abuses children doesn't actually qualify as a pedophile, and the ones who do usually *also* exhibit some other disorder that keeps them from being able to properly control themselves in a number of areas. \n\nAnd if you've got the poor impulse control to molest a child--despite the ethical problems and risk involved--then you might well have the poor impulse to decide bearing your victim's child is sexy instead of a terrible risk. \n\nTurns out, most people understand that molesting children is wrong or at least a serious risk and they decide not to do it even if they feel a sexual attraction to kids.\n\nMoving entirely out of the realm of actual research and into my own personal speculation: I suspect a lot of people conflate homosexuality and pedophilia, and think that people can't help but act on their sexual attractions because we kind of have this narrative that it's inevitable. How many love stories have that \"forbidden love\" trope? Except that a key part of it is that the people involved come to realize their love isn't wrong, just unacceptable. I don't think the analogy holds up if it's a sort of love that actually *is* morally wrong even when you stop and think about it.\n\nWhich really shouldn't come as a surprise.

Another example one time there was an after school activity and one Girl's parents just didn't show up to get her. I don't know if they forgot her or what, but they must not have noticed she hadn't come home? Anyway so i walked her home with us and when we got there the guy is just out front drinking a beer. Yeah, some people don't seem to care about their kid's safety at all.",

One guy they interviewed said the NYPD was doing a sting operation for a serial killer, and the guy got stabbed MULTIPLE times while the cops hid in the conductor's booth.  The victim found out the cops actually came out for a second before going back inside the booth for \"their safety\" while the victim was being stabbed.  So he tried to sue the cops saying it was in their duty to protect him and the judge said he couldn't based on sovereign immunity in common law and that to allow such a case to succeed, would force the cops to start looking at all laws seriously and thus become a police state.\n\nThe other case they go over was one in the 60s or 70s where a single mother gets a restraining order from the father due to fearing for her safety.  One day she notices the kids stopped making noises, so she goes outside and sees them missing.  They eventually turn up dead and the father was the killer.  So she sues the cops for failing to protect her based on the restraining order (I don't remember if she asked them to go after the father due to the restraining order initially) and the judge said pretty much the same thing.\n\nAmerica really shouldn't exist as a country post nixon.",

I'm not a soldier and I have no want to be a cop. I don't know what it takes mentally to handle that kind of role in society, especially the way I've proposed it. But those are the people we need doing the job. Not the ones looking for a paycheck and power trip. \n\nSo maybe if they were constitutionally held to protect us, and we removed qualified immunity and all that bs, we could start to see some change in the kind of people it attracts. I realize in my vision it would require truly selfless people to step up and fill that role but I'm not sure enough of them exist to accomplish that. \n\nOr maybe the entire inner culture of the police itself is broken and it doesn't matter what we do until they themselves fix it from within, or it crumbles and something anew rises from the ashes. \n\nThere's no singular fix though, no one Supreme court ruling that's magically going to fix everything.

They made it clear that America must become a christian nation, only Christians should have the ability to write and pass laws and all Christians are beyond worthy of trust and respect, especially wealthy Christians as \"the blessings of god are a sign of your virtue\". In case you missed it they literally believe that the wealthier you are the more proof of your favor from god-because thats the kind of thing Jesus talked about. I quickly became a red-letter christian at ten years old when my step mother's first act as my step mother was to take so much of my things away- pokemon, cartoons/anime, nintendo, fantasy literature and anytime I had a new interest/hobby it was the devil and evil- for example I wanted to be a paleontologist but the devil hid dinosaur bones in the earth 6000 years ago to make you question your faith. Everything she did she did via a religious causes belle, she said pokemon use magic, the bible condemns magic therefore pokemon is demonic. I quickly came too the conclusion that her god is small and weak and pathetic, A loser god living in constant terror that one of his creation is corrupting the others of his creation and it was the responsibility of the stalwart oppressed Christians ( a plurality is when your group has more members than any one other group. Christians at 33% of the American people represent a plurality as opposed too the majority (up too 75% in the 1960s during the red scare) they had previously represented. This decline is evidence not that America is become a more free and diverse nation but instead that there is a war on Christ) to defend their weak, pathetic worthless unworthy demon god. My parents beat me savagely, and I became more and more convinced that their religion was evil. I told them that every time they beat me they only convinced me further that they worship a false god- a god of their desires manifest and not christ in any form. They sent me here [https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2012/10/28/in-god-s-name/](https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2012/10/28/in-god-s-name/) Where I was further tortured and raped in the name of forcing me too capitulate too their demonic child rape religion. While there I had significantly more biblical literacy than any other student having owed to the religious oppression I faced in the home. I have memorized 1500 verses including 15 chapters and 2 books in my time. I have read their fucking child abuse/rape/slavery manuel 9 times start too finish. I have non-con-sensually sat threw tens of thousands of hours of sermons, lectures, groups, expoes, choirs. I consider myself an absolute expert on American Evangelicalism- which I remind you is in no way related too christian.",

They did sermons and then we‚Äôd color or do crafts. When I was that age, I was really fascinated by dinosaurs. I was coloring a doodle of a brontosaurus when some woman said something so incredibly stupid, it was the first time I realized that adults can be just straight up wrong. She said that dinosaurs were just made up stories like dragons and unicorns. I said that I‚Äôve been to the museum and seen the bones. My school taught us about them. I have books with drawings and facts. Then she said the earth is only 6,000 years old so they couldn‚Äôt be real. And I told her my teacher said it‚Äôs 4.5 billion years old. She said my teacher is ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù and she took my drawing away. I cried for like an hour and just completely stopped participating any time we went over there to the ‚Äústupid people church.‚Äù I even stopped doing the pledge of allegiance that year because it said ‚Äúin god.‚Äù \n\nIf the Satanic Temple can stop kids from going into those fucked up cults we call churches, at such a young age, then I will support them.

Not just because it's a totally preventable problem we've gone backwards on out of pure ignorance, but because of how miserably difficult it is to change the minds of anyone involved.\n\nThe example I always go to is when the nephew of a former coworker got measles during an outbreak a few years back. Her and her family were a part of a demographic in this area that the disease runs through like wildfire because they're essentially the perfect targets for antivax nonsense--devout followers of an insular, fundamentalist religious sect, recent immigrants from parts of the world that gave them generations of reasons to distrust government-endorsed authorities of any kind, and very limited educational attainment. So, of course, none of them were vaccinated, and the response started out as \"it's no big deal, he'll be fine, we're praying on it.\"\n\nThis changed pretty rapidly when the poor kid had to be hospitalized and was in legitimate danger of severe complications from the illness. Suddenly, a lot more of the family was looking to book appointments to get their MMR, and there was a lot of hand-wringing over how much they *wished* they had known better before this all happened and could have prevented it. Now, though, they knew better and would be making sure everyone got vaccinated so this would never happen again, surely.\n\nIt happened two more times in as many years, including an abject refusal to get vaccinated against covid followed rapidly thereafter by several hospitalizations of older family members. The reality was, and is, that for people ideologically set against vaccines for whatever reason, even the pain of personally experiencing the harm these diseases cause is only enough to make an immediate exception at best. It really seems like the only reliable way to not have antivaxers is to prevent people from falling down that rabbit hole in the first place, because there's basically no way to pull them out of it afterwards.",

The punishments that are being doled out are not protecting the kids that are doing what they should do and it's largely because we seem more concerned with protecting the ones that cause the problems rather than protect the ones that are just trying to be good students and get an education. I have sympathy for the problem children but we need a better way of dealing with them. The systems we have now have failed.

Especially for elementary students, if a kid gets an IEP for behavior issues, the school really can‚Äôt expel them without some legal repercussion, either from parents or a government entity. If you break these rules, your school has a chance of losing funding.\n\nFunding is also tied closely to attendance, thus administrators are essentially incentivized to keep as many students as possible. Many administrators are highly reluctant to start expelling students.\n\nSince no Child Left Behind, teaching culture has been pushed to be more inclusive to differently abled students. This can be a good thing, but it has increased having students that are not developmentally ready to be in a classroom. It‚Äôs interesting that since No Child Left Behind achievement gaps have narrowed, meaning students are all closer to the same level. Contradictory, ACT college readiness has continued to drop. My personal theory is the quality of teaching has dropped in that it‚Äôs not really challenging to the average student, which is really a disservice to students. Most curriculum is designed to accommodate lower achieving students in the classroom, so there has been a decline in teaching skills like research, problem solving, and long form writing. These skills take higher level processes that lower achieving students can rarely perform, therefore they are not used. Having behavioral IEPs in a classroom also limits what you can do in a classroom. For example. group work is challenging for these students. Instead of separating this students during these times, teachers are forced to work around them. Often times this means just not doing certain activities. \n\nSorry for the last tangent.

You won't have a clear shot, there will be innocents in the way and you'll bring attention to yourself, possibly even confusing people into believing YOU are the shooter or at least an accomplice. \n\nIf you're going to fight in that situation you have to recognize your disadvantages, but also his. If you manage to close the gap you can take advantage of his disadvantages. Fighting hand to hand with a firearm in your hands is hard enough, without the proper training and experience doing so it's almost impossible. It's also a lot harder to shoot someone when their whole body is pressed against yours, and if that weapon happens to be one of those big scary assault rifles, again, it's almost impossible.\n\nIf you close the gap and can control the weapon just for a few seconds and you've effectively saved the day, because chances are at that point there's going to be more people rushing to your aid to make sure he stays down.\n\nIf you have a knife on you, and you manage to close the gap, you won't even need to worry about help or even your own fighting skills. Chances are the shooter isn't wearing protective gear, and if he is, chances are he has nothing properly protecting his groin.

If you're trained for that type of situation and you can find a secure location to get a good enough shot then by all means be the badass you are but most people don't have that type of training and soldiers certainly do not.\n\nIn fact, the way we're trained is pretty much the opposite. The only time I ever fired my weapon in Afghanistan was to lay down suppressive fire. Basically, you start getting shot at, you hit the ground, take cover, and start firing back. If you see the target that's where you shoot, if not, you just fire in the general direction.\n\nThis is essentially to force the enemy into cover so that he isn't firing at you. You and your fire team are just sending rounds while another fire team flanks for a better shot to successfully eliminate the threat. This is more or less how every firefight goes down in a nutshell. \n\nIn a mass shooting, aside from the fact that firing suppressive fire in a crowd is fucking insane, you're more than likely going to be alone so pretty much everything you've been taught about how to handle a firefight goes right out the window. \n\nIf you're going to use a gun to take out an active shooter, you have to do it in a single shot, and this has nothing to do with marksmanship and everything to do with how close you are to the shooter. If you're far enough away that accurate aim even needs to be considered, you're too far away to take the shot., and honestly, if you're close enough to get a clean shot, you're probably close enough to just tackle the cocksucker anyway, which would most likely still be the quickest and easiest solution.",

My family's children, my friend's children, children of my neighbors and people saying it's no big deal because few people were hurt just don't get it. \n\nWhen this happened we only heard there was a shooting. We had absolutely no details. My sister in law was at work and had no idea that it was happening when my husband called her. We didn't know if she was safe. When we heard there were children hit and one was flown to the hospital in our area that handles serious traumas we still had no idea if it was her. We finally got word from my brother in law, after an hour of waiting, that he got the text to pick her up at the church. She was safe, she wasn't hurt and she was scared. She didn't understand what happened or why her school was surrounded and occupied by cops with huge guns. She didn't understand why she had to be escorted to her dad by 3 officers. Her brother was at the high school and didn't know his sister was safe until he was picked up. \n\nWe are a small community. Many of these kids are children in our families or kids of people we grew up with. The little boy in critical condition is the son of one of my friends from high school. This isn't a mass shooting but that doesn't mean it is being sensationalized by any means. A shooting at a school should never happen but any time it does it should be a big deal, casualties or not. My sister in law has to explain to her child why she experienced the things she did and why she should feel safe to return to school on Monday. She has to explain to her child why a classmate and friend is in the hospital and lost 75% of his blood and is fighting for his life. She has to answer the never ending \"why\"s of a child when she doesn't even have the answers. \n\nWhen they say it can happen anywhere it sure as shit can. I am so thankful that so few people were hurt and that this wasn't a mass shooting. I'm thankful that the police and the school handled this so professionally and were able to get the kids out safely and quickly. I hope for your sake you never have to experience the fear and heartache that comes from something like this. But if you ever do, I hope no one tells you that it is being sensationalized and there was no real threat.",

        "body": "It's not just the states listed that still condone corporal punishment. It happens in every state. In 19 states it's legal to hit a child in public. Last time I googled it, it was *legal in all 50 states to do so in the privacy of your home*. \n\nThe only thing that is illegal is to hit them, *too much.* As your probably thinking to yourself, that's a pretty wide open method of interpretation isn't it Mr. 0GAF? Yep, it absolutely is. The definition for abuse has been getting narrower for a long time, but parents still have a great deal of latitude before the state will intervene on behalf of a child. It's pretty fucking sickening IMHO.\n\nI raised both of my kids (adults now) without ever striking, spanking, slapping or any other form of physical punishment. I was regularly smacked around as a kid and I fucking hated it. I still have some resentment issues about it and I'm old af. My mom, bless her heart, was tyrannical about shit and quick on the draw with whatever was handy. I regularly took the heat for actions of my siblings too, and that really pissed me off and made me resentful. I really really didn't want to generate resentment in my children, or guilt on my head for similar actions. So I looked for an alternative.\n\nOnce you're committed as a parent to never hit your kids you need an alternative because children definitely do require punishment when they act out. I'll briefly explain the method I used. It's commonly referred to as the \"Token Economy.\" I started my kids at 4yrs. old. If you embark on this method, be prepared to do a shit ton of work. TE method involves creating several documents and spreadsheets that you're going to have to keep organized for years to come. Clearly defining rewarding behavior and punishable behavior, and a long list of values that add or subtract to the child's personal economy is a huge task and takes a shitload of your time , at first. Once you have the framework complete, it get's easier to adopt and is also adaptable as they grow up. \n\nEncouraging behavior that's desired, ie, being helpful, following basic rules, and cleaning up without being asked (just some examples), shit like that means you get rewarded, big time! Forgetting to clean up, making a mess or getting into stuff without permission, then you get small but consistent fines and it's paid on the spot. The child has a wallet, you have the bank. I made this very official and all the interactions were calm and patient, even when the child is freaking out. This is very challenging on a personal level, FYI.\n\nThis involves keeping a lot of information and you have to be consistent and \"play by the rule\" yourself. It's absolutely a collaborative learning process. I used poker chips for tokens. 1, 5s &amp; 10s for colors, etc. I also made the relevant copies that teachers needed and sent it to school. It was called the daily tracker. Teachers loved that shit let me tell you, lol. The wallet didn't go to school, only the child and the tracker sheet. And it worked well for me and my kids. They are really great with money as adults too, and I give TE the credit for that. By the time my kids were 10-12 we did away with the TE because we no longer needed to help them modify their behavior. They had developed self control and self awareness of their actions. \n\nIf this sounds like an incredibly complicated and time consuming process, you'd be correct. It takes a lot of patience to make this work, and sometimes it will absolutely challenge you. People will also encourage you to hit your children, usually \"just once\", so they \"know who's boss\", etc. Don't fall for it. Children are super creative self motivated thinking machines. You don't have to use terror on them as teaching method. As adults now, my kids understand what I did and occasionally describe their awe for me. That acknowledgement alone makes it all totally worth the effort.",

Court of Appeals held that police have a general \"public duty,\" but that \"no specific legal duty exists\" unless there is a special relationship between an officer and an individual, such as a person in custody.\n\n&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court has also ruled that police have no specific obligation to protect.

In 2005'sCastle Rock v. Gonzales, a woman sued the police for failing to protect her from her husband after he violated a restraining order and abducted and killed their three children. Justices said the police had no such duty.\n\n&gt;Most recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that police could not be held liable for failing to protect students in the 2018 shooting that claimed 17 lives at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n[Citation](https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/law-and-life/do-the-police-have-an-obligation-to-protect-you/)",

The fucking reporter asked \"what are you feeling right now as you watch this?\"  DK's mom just looked at her like she was insane and said \"Those are my grandchildren...\"  I turned it off at that point, don't know if the reporter got booted out or not.  I think crap like this is why so many people cheer at the reporter getting punched in the die hard movies. ",

Unfortunately, that kind of swift release leads to misinformation.  But rather than point fingers (news, media, social networking, gun laws, lack of gun laws, bad parenting, what have you...) we should all take this time to open our hearts to the ones we love, and also to pay attention to those around us.  Remind our friends and family how much they mean to us, take the time to let them know how important they are in our lives.  That tiny step alone *could* prevent another situation like this from happening in the future.  Of course, there are individuals and groups who have a negative agenda (whether brought about by mental instability, political propaganda, religious zeal, etc.) but perhaps by using love and compassion as a preventive tool we can come together during this time.  \n\nMy entire heart goes out to the families and loved ones who are now suffering from this unspeakable tragedy.

Insurance is only required to cover mental health care \"equally\" as it does the rest. What this often means is that the psychologists and psychiatrists who would be of the most assistance are treated as \"specialists\", requiring a copay of 2-3x that of a general practitioner, despite having to see psychiatrists and psychologists at least once a month, on average, for any semblance of quality care. While they are required to cover the care, they are also not required to have any caregivers in-network. They are also not required to treat psychiatric prescriptions in the same way that they treat non-psychiatric meds. Often, this places the psych meds in the \"premium\" or \"non-preferred\" category.\n&gt;\n&gt;What does all of this mean, really? It means that I, a gainfully employed, 24 year old woman with bipolar disorder cannot afford the help I need, even with the addition of insurance and my husband's income. Copay for a visit to my primary care physician is $25, no matter how frequently I visit. Copay to see a psychologist or psychiatrist is $60. And that's if there's an in-network doctor. There isn't, through my insurance, a single in-network mental health care provider that isn't part of a hospital. Psychologists and psychiatrists at most of these hospitals are there for consultation or to deal with the mental ward, not to take on patients of their own.\n&gt;\n&gt;All told, in order for me to get the care I need to be \"normal\", I need to spend, in-network, $300 per month on doctors (psychologist, for therapy, once a week; psychiatrist, for meds, once a month), and another 50% of the $500/month that my meds cost (because, well, they're non-preferred medications). Out of network? I'm looking at $100 per visit (minimum), with the meds still at $250.\n&gt;\n&gt;I'm lucky. I have insurance. Those who are uninsured are even less likely to be able to get the help they need. Let alone those who are homeless.\n&gt;\n&gt;We need to fix the mental health care system. I think it would help everyone, not just those like me. I think it would help us see less violence in our society.\n",

I was one of the black kids.  \n\nFor some reason, we were all acting up on one particular day.  The white kids and the black kids.  I was not acting up, being the teacher's pet.  I put the \"goody\" in goody-goody.  But I do remember laughing at some of the hijinks.\n\nThe teacher was this old school black woman.  By \"old school\", I mean you always had to address her by \"ma'am\" .  She was the kind of teacher who would snatch you up out of your chair if you were acting up.  She was one strict lady.  You didn't want to mess with her.\n\nSo on this day when the class was acting up, the teacher stood by the door and called out a bunch of names.  The students who were called were to go out into the hall.  I could tell by her demeanor that these students were really gonna get it.  Glad I wasn't them!  Then she called my name.  I was so confused.  I was in trouble too?  Was it because I had laughed?\n\nWe were in the hallway.  She closed the door and proceeded to lay into us, with a level of anger I'd never seen in her before.  We were an embarrassment.  We were terrible.  We brought shame on our families, on our people.  She couldn't stand to look at us.  We were a disgrace...for our race.\n\nI looked at us and realized that we were all black.  She had singled out all the black kids.\n\nDidn't we know the sacrifices that had made for us to go to this nice school?  Didn't we understand the responsibility we had to represent our people, our heritage, in the very best light?  \n\nShe acknowledged that the white kids had been cutting up too.  But so what?  We had to be better than the white kids. The white kids didn't have 300 years of negative stereotypes hanging over their heads.  We did. \n\nI felt the tears well up in my eyes.  It wasn't fair that I had to be subjected to this tirade.   Here I was, working my ass off to be a goody-goody, but it wasn't enough.  I was still being lumped with the \"bad\" kids.  I started to wonder if maybe I wasn't the \"good girl\" I thought I was. Maybe I really was the embarrassment she said we were. I regretted laughing at the hijinks.  I must have laughed too loud and now my reputation was forever tarnished!\n\nAnd then she noticed me getting all emotional and she pulled me over to her.  \"Autotelica is the only one here who makes me proud.  She does her work, she makes good grades, she doesn't act up.  She's the best student in the class. Y'all need to be more like her.\"\n\nIn that moment, I felt a Nellie Olson smile of smugness break on my face.  But when she dismissed us and we returned to our seats, I felt that sadness again.  She said that I was special and I should have been happy about that.  But I still felt dressed down, ashamed, and embarrassed. I felt like the white kids knew that we had been singled out for racial reasons.  That embarrassed me.   I felt like my black brothers and sisters hated me for being so goody-goody.  That embarrassed me too.  Later, as I got older, I realized that the white kids would never have to hear a speech like that directed at them, while I would be subjected to similar speeches multiple times over the course of my education. \n\nI recently told my parents this story. I had never told them about it before because it was so surreal that I can almost convince myself it didn't happen.  They thought my fourth grade teacher was right to dress us down like that.  Of course they would.  They were \"old school\" too.\n\nI loved my teacher, but I just don't know if what she did was right.  It certainly didn't change anyone's behavior, in my recollection.  It just made me hate being black, at least for a short while.",

She was smart--could have been anything she had wanted to be if she hadn't been born and raised in the Deep South as a black woman.  We had been given opportunities that she and others in her generation could never have dreamed of for themselves, and yet here we were, taking those opportunities for granted. \n\nI'm not fully sold on the whole slam against \"respectability politics\", so that's another sign I'm kinda old school. I did not get a feeling that my teacher was yelling at us just because we weren't sufficiently appeasing white folks.  She was also yelling at us because we weren't appeasing her and other black folks--the ones who had fought so hard for us to go to integrated schools.  They hadn't fought just so that we could get into mischief with white kids.  They had fought so that we could be the doctors, lawyers, and board presidents that the white kids were destined to be by virtue of their birth. And yet here we were, taking their fight for granted.\n\nI think where she went wrong was yelling at *all* of us.  Like, yeah, she singled me out as special, but what about the black kids who were neither angels like myself or the demons like the actual ruffians.  Like the black kids who got mostly Bs rather than mostly As.  Were those kids embarrassing too?  Or like the black kids who were in the gifted program (a group I was not a member of, personally) and tested well, but would sometimes not turn in homework assignments...just like any other bored-out-of-their-mind gifted kid.  Like the black kids who would get caught chewing gum and passing notes in class, but were otherwise well-behaved and adequately performing, academic-wise.  She didn't single those kids out for special recognition.  It was just me, the perfect student, who got that recognition.  Well, no one should have to be perfect to avoid being called \"embarrassing\".  I think if she had just fussed at the black kids who had been acting up on the regular, maybe the righteousness of her actions that day would not be so ambiguous.  \n\nI had an inferiority/self-esteem complex for a long time, well into my 20s.  I don't blame what happened in the fourth grade on that because that would be crazy.  But I think being constantly told that I had to be better than everyone else to get the same level of respect did a number on me, psychologically.  Even if it was true.  Like, you're telling me that if I fail my calculus test like any other first-year college student, not only will I be a disappointment to myself, but my entire race?  I got all that on my shoulders?  I felt like my failures--however normal and insignificant they were--were always huge because I wasn't just representing myself, but millions of other people.  *If I use incorrect grammar while doing my presentation, they are going think I'm a mealy-mouthed negro!*  *If I show up five minutes late to this appointment, they are going to think I'm a lazy negro.*  *If I laugh a little too loud, they are going to think I'm a loud boisterous ignorant negro.*  No one should be burdened by such thoughts.

        "body": "I cant find a picture of those boys, but it said they were from a Tongan boarding school. Golding's Lord of the Flies is a commentary on the genteel savagery taught to the class of expensive British boarding schools. These boys were separated from their mothers at a young age, beaten, sexually assaulted, mentally downtrodden, fed slop, made to sleep in cold rooms, dressed in poor itchy clothes, and told they needed to keep a stiff upper lip and deal with it. They would then turn their abuse on each other when left in their commons. That social \"education\" they got at the boarding school was more important than the classroom education, and would propel them to careers as politicians and men of importance, and they would go on to do the same to their own sons. Roald Dahl wrote about this when he wasn't writing childrens novels.\n\nGolding wrote Lord of the Flies to show what happens when British society says the quiet part of what they were teaching and doing to their boys out loud. On the island, there were no constraint, and what would have been done in secret in the dorms was done out in the open.  Thays what the final line about the \"British schoolboys\" means- British culture had been like this all along and now a light was shined on it. The book is a criticism of British class culture, not a thought experiment about how young boys of any nationality would get along. I dont think you can compare an allegory about British society to 6 boys who aren't even British. \n\nLord of the Flies is best read with a bit more context if it's being read outside of the UK in 2021. It's a good book and I think relevant to other countries' culture, but needs to be preceded by something like Boy by Roald Dahl for context. Even the first Harry Potter book very briefly references this sort of attitude towards generational school abuse with Dudley, who is going to the same boarding school as his father at age 11 where part of the uniform includes a stick to hit other students with. That sounds dumb AF, but is a parody on the actual type of school Vernon would have attended and despite the abuse he copped he thinks its a good school and he'll be sending his son.",

My school district REQUIRES that we teach middle schoolers lessons on racism. If I DON‚ÄôT do that, I would potentially be in trouble. The topic of rape is a bit advanced, sure, but it‚Äôs not like the rape is shown/depicted in the film. It‚Äôs described in a courtroom - pretty vanilla stuff. \n\nThe Lottery (both the short story and the film) are part of our 8th grade curriculum. Fantastic story about societal pressure and the issues with senseless adherence to tradition. The short film presents good opportunities for text-to-film comparison, analysis of visual storytelling, creative license, and the analysis of directorial decision-making. Probably my favorite short story I read with my 8th graders. We read it and watched the film early this school year, in October. I could see it being taught to 6th/7th graders, no problem. \n\nAnd on ‚ÄúThe Hobbit‚Äù, if the teacher regularly fills time with unnecessary movies, then that‚Äôs not great (although my district encourages an occasional ‚Äúfree day‚Äù as a reward if the class has been very successful). In addition, the article only speculated that the teacher does this frequently and never divulged if the teacher attaches any academic activities to the movie. Once again, my district encourages innovation. If the teacher could use ‚ÄúThe Hobbit‚Äù to teach some skill or content that the curriculum requires rather than some other material, then so be it. Again, if he is frequently showing movies for no reason and frequently straying from the curriculum then that may be another story. To me, this sounds more like a teacher who wants to provide his students with a diverse and, depending on how he was using the materials, challenging set of experiences.",

When we developed pictures, we had a responsibility to report any child pornography to authorities.\n\n\nBut we had criteria.  A naked kid in a bath tub is usually fine.  A topless toddler girl in a diaper was fine.  These things were usually pretty innocent and common.  The only time we had trouble was when children were shown in sexual situations. ... An adult is also nude, or in extreme cases penetration (I never actually saw that myself).   But a teen girl flashing the camera was pretty common and we never had a problem with that.\n\n\nI don't know the details of these pictures, and I realize that laws probably have changed, and they vary by state.  But it seems like someone has to look at the pictures and determine if they are \"sexy\" or not.  And that is a very subjective thing.\n\n\nFor instance, if I have a picture of my 8 month old daughter naked it's no problem.  If I have a naked picture of the same girl at 3,its probably not an issue.  But if a have a naked picture of my 17 year old daughter naked, it's agreeably very creepy.\n\nSomewhere along the line of child development, someone is determining that the picture is \"too sexy\".  I wonder who is considered the authority on that matter.  Who makes the call of what is \"porn\" and what is innocent?  And what is unacceptable?  Does a little butt crack or cleavage count?  Is it full bare ass or exposed nipples?  Is it penises and vaginas?\n\n\nI agree with authorities that the line needs to be drawn somewhere.  I would just be interested to see exactly where it's drawn.  Especially if there are going to be legal charges pressed against a minor...which seems a little heavy handed. ",

To answer your question, there's a test (miller for general \"pornography\" and another for child \"pornography\") to determine what constitutes \"obscene\" material (and therefore porn).  For the one for children, even clothed children in certain poses qualify as obscene.  On the other side, fully nude children may not.  There's a significant nudism population out there where having a picture of your 17 year old daughter naked is really not a big deal.  It can be evidenced at the various places those people can go to such as beaches and resorts.  I wish Western cultures could adopt such a simple principle where that nudity in and of itself is not sexual, obscene, or pornographic.

As a rule, we should be striving for wording that is descriptive and not euphemistic, while above all being accurate and fair.\n\n&gt; The New York Times legal team and newsroom share a similar goal: ensuring accurate and fair reporting. **Truth is a defense to libel, so safeguarding the accuracy of our stories protects the newspaper against legal liability.**\n\n&gt; But we also understand that stories must be readable. When discussing claims of sexual harassment or assault, readers (and other lawyers) may want us to use technical legal terms ‚Äî for example, ‚Äúaggravated sexual assault.‚Äù **But a news story is not a legal treatise. And the definition of a crime often varies from state to state.**\n\n&gt; The easiest way to report claims of sexual harassment or assault without incurring legal liability is to cite the language contained in legal documents, such as complaints or police reports. The media may republish statements made in official public documents regardless of whether the statements ultimately prove false.\n\n&gt; When we don‚Äôt have legal records to rely on, we try to ensure that events are described as accurately as possible. This often requires relying on information provided to us by those involved in the incident or those who have some knowledge of it.\n\n&gt; **Using an evocative phrase or term to describe certain behavior may make for more interesting reading, but it may also suggest more than we know.** When deciding how to describe these claims, we try to use language that reflects what our reporter has learned but does not imply more. In this effort, reporters and lawyers are generally united ‚Äî both are working to produce a story that is at once truthful and clear.\n\nThat being said, what the teacher did was horrific and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.

This was an argument presented in the ratification debates.[46]\nThe first legislation on the subject was The Militia Act of 1792 which provided, in part:\nThat each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia, ... every citizen, so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock....\n\n&amp;\n\n&gt; The Militia Act of 1903 divided what had been the militia into what it termed the \"organized\" militia, created from portions of the former state guards to become state National Guard units, and the \"unorganized\" militia consisting of all males from ages 17 to 45, with the exception of certain officials and others, which is codified in 10 U.S.C. ¬ß 311\n\n&amp;\n\n&gt; In the 2008 decision of the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller, the de jure definition of \"militia\" as used in United States jurisprudence was discussed. The court's opinion made explicit, in its obiter dicta, that the term \"militia\", as used in colonial times in this originalist decision, included both the federally-organized militia and the citizen-organized militias of the several States: \"... the 'militia' in colonial America consisted of a subset of 'the people'‚Äîthose who were male, able-bodied, and within a certain age range\" (7) ... Although the militia consists of all able-bodied men, the federally organized militia may consist of a subset of them\"(23)\n\nas for \"regulated\" this is what i found\n\n&gt; The Random House College Dictionary (1980) gives four definitions for the word \"regulate,\" which were all in use during the Colonial period and one more definition dating from 1690 (Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, 1989). They are:\n1) To control or direct by a rule, principle, method, etc.\n2) To adjust to some standard or requirement as for amount, degree, etc.\n3) To adjust so as to ensure accuracy of operation.\n4) To put in good order.\n[obsolete sense]\nb. Of troops: Properly disciplined. Obs. rare-1.\n\n\n\nmore stuff on both \"militia\" and \"regulated\" here regarding historical useage. http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndmea.html\nthough i took my quotes on \"militia\" from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia#United_States\n\n*edit* good to see citing sources for an easily verifiable position still gets the odd person downvoting.",

One is to have students alternate distance learning days with in-person days. Others include students wearing masks and having their temperatures checked every day.**\n\nMaryland\n\n&gt;The Maryland Department of Education has six requirements that need to be agreed on before schools reopen ‚Äì daily health screening for symptoms; physical distancing; mask requirements for adults; proper hygiene training; personal protective equipment for school nurses and other staff; and isolating at home, if sick.\n\n&gt;**The state's Department of Education also recommends students come to school for two to three days a week, in a staggered manner, and have longer days at school.**\n\nMassachussetts\n\n&gt;The new academic year has been postponed for two weeks and will be cut to 170 days from 180. All schools must resume classes in-person, online, or a hybrid of the two by Sept. 16, according to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.\n\n&gt;**During in-person instruction, elementary schools should keep students in the same group throughout the day. Middle and high schools do not have to but are urged to minimize mixing student groups as much as possible.**\n\nNew York\n\n&gt;Schools in New York state will reopen based on regional conditions, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. **Schools in areas that are in phase 4 of reopening can resume in-person instruction if the daily infection rate is below 5%, using a 14-day average after Aug. 1.**\n\nSo while some of them are taking precautions, all of them are allowing in-person classes if schools want it.",

They live in households with other people of different age groups who all interact with different portions of the community. Shutting down the schools during the initial outbreak potentially kept cases down by another order of magnitude. Think about it. As an adult, how frequently are you in a building with 100s/1000s of people packed densely together for 6 hours a day? For the majority of adults, the answer is close to never. For the majority of children the answer is 5 days a week for around 180 days a year.\n\nChildren lack the autonomy to be able to decide best practices and what is safe for themselves. They are forced to go along with the herd. Even worse is that they are usually ignorant of or defiant against safe practices. Then those same children return to their households every afternoon and night. People who have and work amongst children get sick from normal illnesses more frequently due to kids being Petri dishes.

My wife and I were literally sick to our stomachs when he announced a multimillion dollar lawsuit. We just wanted to cover our daughters medical expense, pay for future medical and educational expenses, and maybe have enough left over to take her to Disney World.\n\n$500,000 + in medical bill would cripple 99% of American households.

Dr. appointments. \n\nIf you're so insulted about the dollar amount of the lawsuit, you have a right to be, but for all the wrong reasons. \n\nThe man who owned the gun, should have never owned it based on his previous history (murder charge, 2 weapons stolen and used in the commission of an armed robbery). His lawyer argued that because his weapon was \"stolen\" (it was kept loaded and  unlocked in a night stand where the boy slept) he had no responsibility for what happened as a result of his negligence. \n\nThe State of Washington court system found his actions acceptable. Yet if you're a restaurant or bar owner and serve someone a drink and later that evening that partron causes an accident because they are impaired you are responsible for the drivers actions, how does that make any sense?\n\nAs for the school district, they knew the kid had a history of reacting violently towards classmates. When 17/ 23 kids in my daughters class knew the week before the incident that a student was planning to bring a gun to school, not one kid spoke up to inform an adult that a student in their class was planning on bringing in a weapon. \n\nUnfortunately none of these details were ever released by the media since it didn't fit their narrative of the events that day.

There is no public safety interest in stripping felons of voting rights for life, for example. Nobody who's for disenfranchising felons for life argues that the political system has to be protected from criminals *voting*. The reason is always that the felons deserve infinite punishment and every aspect of their life should be fucked up forever because their debt to society can never be paid.\n\nFine, so don't let them out at all, ever, if that's the case.\n\nI knew a guy who got busted for dealing pot to adults once. He wasn't a robber, a liar, a fraud, an assaulter, or anything of the type. He was a low-grade independent retailer who specialized in an illegal substance. He couldn't find honest work after he got finished with his sentence because he had a felony on his record. He couldn't get a job breaking rocks. Do you wanna guess if this person has stayed on the straight and narrow or if they have gone back to the one industry where their entrepreneurial spirit and work ethic has been rewarded? The risk of legal retaliation is a moot point for this person now because it's not like they had a fair chance to come clean after their sentence was served. It was: legally starve, or take some risks and pay bills\n\nThe point is that if you are going to let criminals out at all you have to give them a fair chance to come clean, which our current system doesn't do, otherwise what you are doing is actually increasing the risk they will go back and commit more crimes, and it actually kinda makes a mockery of the whole idea of incarceration as serving rehabilitation **and** public safety",

Look at the event apart from that and tell me the kid didn't deserve to be reprimanded. A suspension is *nothing*, he'll forget it happened in a month and so will his parents.

They need to have a way to deal with that.\n\nMeantime, the kid learned a lesson about making a threat, even a totally unrealistic fake one.  And all his classmates did too.  A lesson they wouldn't have learned if the teacher had just laughed it off, and when, later on down the road, the same kid (or a different one) made a similar threat and it was more credible because of their age, and big trouble resulted, who's fault would that have been?\n\nA skilled teacher can diffuse a situation like this before it gets to a standoff resulting in the need for a suspension, most of the time.  I've been in classrooms and I've marveled at that skill, time and time again.  Where they can't, there's something about the child that makes them behave inappropriately, and the best thing for everyone, including the child, is clear and consistent consequences.  Now maybe this teacher was over reacting, or new and not skilled, but my experience makes me want to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Without more information, I'm going to assume he was asked nicely to remove the backpack, and the threat was an inappropriate response to a classroom request and the teacher's authority there, which needed to be address regardless of how ridiculous the threat was.",

For example - in a classroom. \n\nThe problem with not drawing until you have made the decision to fire is a lot of people, especially the inner city thugs and drug addicts, will not take you seriously if the firearm is not trained on them. If you have a firearm on your person holstered you should not allow somebody to get within 21 feet of you. Under that, there is a 50/50 chance somebody can bumrush you, and beat you to it, and take it from you. But if you already drawn and aimed at the target distance wont matter. And your shot placement should you choose to discharge the firearm is likely to be much more accurate.

If your a 130lb woman squaring off against a 240lb man. As a woman, you should draw your firearm, point it square at his chest, and tell him to BTFO.

Cahoctah is a small township north of Howell but there's literally just farms and one gas station. It's not really big enough to call a city so it gets lumped in with Howell a lot.

This event isn't even about LGBT history or civil rights or the abuses committed by homophobes. No one is teaching 4th graders about the AIDS crisis. No one is giving demonstrations of gender reassignment surgeries to 2nd graders. No one is _exposing kids to anything in public schools besides the concept of tolerance of people who aren't exactly like you._ The agenda that received death threats is linked in the article, but here it is for convenience. Some of these comments make me think people didn't even bother reading the document they're supposedly outraged about, because none of its events or topics are even _arguably_ inappropriate for Pre-K level students.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1cJwldQZKVWEXggbpcUZCwMdXWU3Nw2i1eVtoZRG1IxM/edit\n\nThe _entire thing_ is about promoting acceptance, supporting your friends and loved ones, figuring out the kind of person you want to be, and trying to be a more compassionate person to others. If there's anything even remotely inappropriate in that schedule, I'm not seeing it.\n\nSometimes when a kid is 9 or 10 and they start to \"like-like\" one of their peers, they find that their friends keep talking about girls they think are pretty, but they like boys. Having a week teaching the _basic principles_ that one of their friends might like boys instead of girls, or girls and boys, or maybe they don't like anyone like that and never end up liking anyone like that even as an adult, or that one of their classmates has two dads instead of a mom and a dad, or only one mom and no dad, or no parents and live with a guardian, and that that's okay and they shouldn't be made fun of or bullied for being different, is something that might have saved _so many kids who are now adults_ the pain of having their friends or their parents or their church reject them.\n\nAnd I find the suggestion that such concepts should be left to the parents, rather than teachers who are involved in caring for both straight and LGBT students alike, _and providing both with a safe and welcoming classroom environment,_ kind of abhorrent in light of the fact that _most_ homophobic attitudes that result in bullying of LGBT kids stem directly from the homophobic attitudes of the same parents you think will teach them LGBT history and the civil rights movement at home. In fact, most of the LGBT youth in this country that commit suicide on a daily basis are due to _their own parents disowning them because of their sexuality or gender identity._ Because if anything destroys a child's psyche, it's _rejection by their parents, friends, and adult caretakers for an aspect of themselves that they didn't ask for._\n\nI was one of the _few_ fortunate people to be born into a family that genuinely loves and supports each other, _and I didn't feel comfortable coming out until I was 27._ I've known I'm bisexual and more interested in other guys since I was _10._ For reference, I'm 28 now and I've had an openly lesbian cousin who came out at 15, 14 years ago.\n\nThe existence, validity, humanity, and dignity of LGBT people is not a matter of debate or an issue of _differing opinions._ It's neither bizarre nor aggressive to refute the erasing of LGBT people from society because their sheer existence makes some assholes _uncomfortable._",

I understand the necessity to highlight a death like that, but the response was unlike anything I've seen in my lifetime. It's also disturbing to me how a lot of the people chosen as martyrs of this movement against police brutality are also lifelong criminals who were confronted by the police while committing a crime at their time of death.\n\nI'm a Texas native living in the city where Timpa was killed, and it really made me step back from the BLM/riots thing because there's such a stark difference in how these two people have been treated when the cries of the movement should hold them both up as examples of what bad policing does.\n\nTimpa was having trouble with his mental state and called the police *on himself* for help and ended up dead. Arguably a worse situation than the circumstances around Floyd's death, all things considered.\n\nIt's godawful how police have been enabled to police in then way they do jumping immediately to physical altercations for minor issues, and the Floyd video was as disturbing as any other police brutality bodycam/liveleak style video. He was murdered, and whether it was intentional or not remains for Chauvin to know, but any reasonable person can see that at the very least he should have been given an ambulance ride for what he proclaimed was a breathing/covid problem and not tortured. I'm not sure the movement changed people's minds about that. \n\nIt pointed a spotlight, sure, and I hate being a 'look at the stats' guy because it's often insensitive to realities of life, but the overreaction by the media and the whole movement is also quite jarring because while I think that any senseless death is awful, the stats just don't line up with the response. \n\nThe ~1000 or so average deaths at the hands of police per year include ALL races and a vast majority of them were due to a conflict with the police and *not* just random acts of violence by the police.\n\nThat number is *dwarved* by the amount of murder committed by citizens to each other over 10:1. This narrative of 'being hunted in the streets' that's pushed by the media and among black groups is not only disingenuous but dangerous. When those who live in an area that need policing are calling for *more* police, but the nation and media are calling to defund and downsize police, there's a severe mismatch between what's right and what's needed, and unfortunately, I don't think less funding and less presence will help quell the problems that police are able to solve without being given *more* training and resources. \n\nWhen I see how people, both in real life and here on social media sites are reacting, I fear that we're never going to reach the peace that each group exclaims it wants without destroying each other first. There's going to be a lot of inter-racial resentment in the coming years and how we treat each other will inevitably become worse.",

You always have to put your guard up in that area. Rosemead is in the San Gabriel Valley, which is the Asian part of town and a Mecca for the homeless. I have no doubt the man who attacked him is a transient. I myself have been racially attacked by homeless just waiting for the bus a number of times and have seen them attack others. That area is mostly devoid of Black people so the few black homeless people that are there often get upset with the Asian immigrants when they try to ignore them. I remember there was a black guy in a bus once just staring down Asian immigrants and yelling \" What, you've never seen a black man before?\" Riding that bus, I have heard black and white transients attack them for being immigrants. It's like the native born homeless in that area resent Asian immigrants for being better off than them and I feel like they can say whatever they want to them because they are not going to get called out on the count they are homeless. What's more upsetting is that most people who ride the bus in that area are Asian immigrants who don't speak much English, are elderly, usually alone and when they are attacked unprovoked, their main line of the defense is to ignore them and hope to God they don't get physically attacked. Most of the transients don't even live there and they're the ones who are upset when Asian people move in. Bottom line. I believe the transient community must be policed more.

Dash cam video shows that after she passes the officer, he pursues her for about 30 seconds but doesn‚Äôt catch up with her until after she pulls into the Wendy‚Äôs lot and parks.\n\n&gt;King gets out of her car and heads toward the restaurant but stops when Richter asks her to get back in her car. He walks toward her and asks her again to get back in the car. She does but apparently doesn‚Äôt close the door. The two of them are now out of view of the police officer‚Äôs dash cam.\n\n&gt;According to the officer‚Äôs report, he says he asked King for her driver‚Äôs license, which was in her wallet under the driver‚Äôs seat. She questions whether he can ticket her after she is already parked.\n\n&gt;‚ÄúI was increasingly concerned with her uncooperative attitude and did(n‚Äôt) feel safe returning to me (sic) vehicle to complete the stop with her sitting half way out of the vehicle,‚Äù he wrote.\n\nAnd those saying she was speeding anyway, this happened in Texas.

Next call - suicidal woman same area. have a convo on why she took so many pills. Get her with local mental aid at the hospital. Next call - warrant service- assist detectives with suspect. He runs, pushing detectives aside. I catch up and we struggle to arrest him. Use open hand techniques (no not slapping lol). He relaxes. I tell the detectives to ease off he's not resisting anymore. They do. Traffic Stop- Know in my head its the most dangerous thing we do. Try not to think about the videos shown in the academy of officers begging for their life. License plate is suspended. Carefully approach car and touch rear light so there are finger prints in case I get hurt or killed. Window is tinted and the door suddenly flies open. Oh Fuck, Oh Fuck. Swollow hard and start scanning, thinking is \"he or she armed is he or she armed??\" Woman pops head out and says \"my window doesn't roll down\". I visibly deflate. So relieved, give warning about plate (had insurance) and help fasten the childs seat in the back the proper way.- end rant\n",

That makes them inherently more dangerous than other types of dogs.\n\n  They're great/amazing dogs. Specifically there are many people utilizing those breed traits by using Pitts to hunt huge feral hogs in the south eastern US/Appalachia . Other lines are bred for weight pulling competitions -- the same genetics that make them excellent at these jobs also gets game bred dogs amped up at the sight of running/shouting/playing children who make sudden movements like prey and activate chase reflexes. This makes untrained free roaming dogs a serious public threat to safety.  \n\n  Saying that \"Pitt bulls are more dangerous when they do bite\" is different from saying \"all Pitt bulls bite.\"  \n\n",

They are too busy getting blacks to feel like victims to help blacks improve their lives.\n\n&gt;As a non-white immigrant, why should I look at the difference between non-white immigrants and black Americans when there's very little that's analogous about us beyond our non-whiteness?\n\nBecause many people are claiming that racism is the root cause for black people failing in America.\n\n&gt;There are 42 million black people in America, most lower to middle-middle class. This \"cultural\" angle you're trying to push is universal to broke people.\n\nYou did not read the article.\n\n&gt;The median household income for black families falls squarely in the middle of all Florida counties. So do the rates of poverty, reliance on food stamps and unemployment. Children here are no more likely to live with an unmarried mother or father.\n\nThese blacks aren't broke and their schools are not underfunded.\n\n&gt; You got to Mexico, it's broke kids who are underperforming in schools relative to their better funded counterparts. If you go to Nigeria, it's broke families fucking around. \n\nBlacks in this case are failing despite any economic difference. Poor kids do worse than rich kids, but poor black kids do worse than poor white kids. This is a cultural problem. Culture defines itself along racial lines in this case (and in many cases).\n\nAlso in absolute terms, these failing black schools are very well funded. You will find schools throughout Asia, South America, Europe that do much better despite having less funding.\n\nYou could double the funding. If black parents aren't raising their black children to respect their teachers, do their homework, and be respectful, then those teachers will not stay in those schools and the good black kids will be dragged down.\n\nThis is not strictly a racial problem. It is a cultural problem. For many reasons cultures define themselves among racial lines, as the article points out whites making laws to segregate black people in the past is a huge part of the reason this is now happening. But what allows it to keep happening is shitty black culture.   \n\n",

But, everyone seems to be missing the part where the article explicitly states that these black kids do NOT come from unusually poor families for that region.\n\nThat's one of the problems with America these days. The article says \"black kids\" but everyone reads \"poor kids\" because we refuse to believe that black kids would do worse in school unless there was a socioeconomic cause, and preferably one which could be blamed on a white privileged class. The fact that we always believe the word \"black\" is synonymous with the word \"poor\" should be considered racist, but since we do it out of a misplaced sense of guilt and an attempt to defend the black community we don't seem to mind.\n\nAlso let's remember that the article uses the word \"segregation\" but it's not talking about the same kind of racial segregation which occurred in our nation's history. The schools' student populations aren't intentionally being split down racial lines. They're being split by residency and proximity, which is similar to how the student populations are split up in every major city. It just so happens that schools surrounded by primarily black communities will have mostly black students, while schools surrounded by mostly white communities will have mostly white students.\n\nThe \"de-segregation\" in question was merely the local government's method of looking like they were working on solving the eduction problem in the black community. They bused black kids from the mostly black community further away to schools in mostly white communities where the average test scores and graduation rates were higher. No doubt this education initiative garnered some political support from the black community too since it's basically the local government's way of telling the black parents that there's nothing wrong with their kids other than they're not being given all the privileges white kids are afforded. A narrative which the black community has been trying to sell the country on for decades.\n\nHowever, the local and state governments aren't stupid. They have access to the test scores and the demographic statistics. They know what the problem is, it's just not something they can sell the public on. So the government was pretending that if the black schools are failing then it must be because they lack some kind of socioeconomic benefit which the mostly white schools have at their disposal. Once again, using the same \"black means poor\" misconception to sell the public on this education imitative, a misconception based on statistics which in this case weren't even true.\n\nBut the overall hope of the local and state governments was that they could mask the real problem by further mixing the student population. It may result in a lower graduation rate for mostly white schools, but they were also hoping it would result in some of that \"education is a priority\" philosophy rubbing off on the black kids who will then take that back to their neighborhood. All at a huge cost to the local taxpayer whose money goes to busing the kids further and further away to ever more capable schools.\n\nThe problem is that when the busing of kids to further away schools stops (a policy mistakenly referred to as de-segregation) the issue becomes painfully obvious... Black neighborhoods have an education problem and it's doesn't always coincide with an economic problem. The black neighborhood can match the local economic average and yet it still suffers from a severe education issue. I'm sure someone would love to argue that it's about privilege rather than money, but I don't know how that really applies.\n\nThe root of the issue is a community which all across America is generally engaging in anti-social behavior and then blaming it one the rest of the country in a \"us versus them\" mentality of paranoid delusions of persecution. A community which believes the world is against it and teaches their children that there is nothing they can do to succeed because the word will hold them back at every turn. When you raise kids to believe they have no chance to make something of themselves it should be no surprise that they don't even try to succeed.\n\nIn Dallas where I grew up there were three main high schools in my area. The one I attended was surrounded by a mostly middle class neighborhood, while the other two were surrounded by mostly rich white neighborhoods. Everyone wanted to go to mine because it had the best test scores, the higher graduation rate, and less violence. Why were the other two schools worse despite being surrounded by rich neighborhoods consisting of mostly white families?... Because those rich neighborhoods were also near to some very poor black neighborhoods, and those kids got to go to the rich white school because it was the closest to their place of residence. So the rich white kids had to go to school along side poor black kids, and the mixing of the two turned into a mess. When I had to go visit the other schools for sporting events I was surprised how crappy they had become. It's like the building was falling apart and there was graffiti all over the place, which wasn't what you'd expect from the area the school was in. Turns out all the rich white parents began sending their kids to private schools, then the public school became a mostly poor black school in the middle of the rich white neighborhood. But guess who still paid taxes which went towards that public school? The rich white parents did, and their money didn't help put the poor black kids on the right path. Money didn't fix the issue because the problem wasn't caused by a lack of money.",

But when it's \"improving\" from 97% to 98%, you're just wasting the student's time.  The student could instead have mastered the year's material in 6 months, and then progressed to either a wider or deeper set of topics with the remaining time.\n\nWhen geometry classrooms have to spend half their time on algebra, that the \"high performing\" students end up with higher grades doesn't mean they've actually learned more geometry - it means that the material was too easy for them.  It means they're given so much time to work that on their triple-check, they catch a meaningless, careless arithmetic error (one with no bearing whatsoever on their actual understanding of \"new\" content), and as a result get 59/60 instead of 58/60.\n\nThere absolutely are exceptions, but the primary focus is to meet certain minimal standards, not to challenge every student.  It's not about individual growth, about ending the year more educated than the student started it; it's about clearing a hurdle.  Kids who walk into the room already able to jump high enough just end up ignored (unless they're lucky enough to have hit on one of the exceptions).\n\nAs pressure mounts to show \"improvement,\" to reduce gaps, to raise graduation rates, the bars just get lower and lower - because that's the easiest way to create the data sets that society demands.  Let's jump right to the extreme - AP classes, the (undeserved) gold standard of catering to advanced students.

But never mind any of that!  Look at how many *well-qualified* calculus students we have!\n\nIf the effect to be measured is (scaled/interpreted) grades on an exam that's too easy in the first place, then sure - (wide) heterogeneous grouping has a slight positive effect on the high-performing students, and huge performance improvement among low-performing students.  If the effect to be measured is being *challenged*, having to struggle academically and improving oneself for it, striving to reach one's potential...not so much.\n\nIf the goal is for every student to learn a specific list of facts and skills, fine.  \nBut I think the goal should be for every student to *learn*.",

And they're so focused on this narrative of what they think they deserve that they have no room to consider other people, and even start seeing members of their family as things they possess, as what they're entitled to control.\n\nIt's also a way to feel \"heroic\" while actually being so self-absorbed that nothing can break the reality in your head, where you're simply the wronged victim and society is evil.",

I‚Äôm September we had an active shooting in the neighborhood and the suspect ran from the police by hiding at the school. We were on lock down for several hours. I had to swallow my tears and push it all away and keep comforting my class of 10 year olds who were crying for their parents. We didn‚Äôt know the situation except that the police put us on lock down because there was an armed suspect on campus. And we could hear the helicopters. I hid them in a corner, in the dark and quiet sobs. And I moved quietly and slowly, crawling on my hands and knees to spend time rubbing each child‚Äôs back and to tell them it was ok. For hours. In my heart I decided that I had no choice but to do everything I could to protect these kids and I hoped that didn‚Äôt mean talk a shooter out of it or worse. And as a mom, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd want my kids‚Äô teacher to do. And as a mom, that meant I was deciding to die if I had to. Luckily the police apprehended the suspect (who had no intention of being at our school or harming kids) and everyone got home safe. School teachers should never ever have to be in this position. But here we are. The students &amp; teachers in Texas were not as lucky as we were. This is a huge problem, no one really feels safe in elementary schools anymore. Every time the bell rings or we have a drill the students start welling up with tears. It‚Äôs not right. My heart aches because I know the teacher who died was put in an impossible position, for what? Is it finally enough? I just can‚Äôt even imagine the pain those families are feeling. Hopefully their deaths won‚Äôt be forgotten and will bring about change.",

I don't really have words to explain what I saw yesterday happen in Texas.\n\nI grew up in Colorado, started school less than a year removed from the Columbine School Shooting where 13 people were innocently killed by two deranged students whose names need not be mentioned. in the 12 years of school I had in Colorado, fears of another school shooting happening waned. I graduated and went on to college in the summer of 2012. Not even 5 months later, Sandy Hook experienced the single largest loss of life in any school shooting ever.\n\nThose students who were killed at Sandy Hook should be graduating next year. That's not a joke.\n\nI didn't have the comprehension nor the empathy to understand the horrors perpetrated at either of the events mentioned. But now that I am a father, and spending all morning on my child's last full day of 1st grade thinking about the heartbreak the parents to these children must be facing, it has become abundantly clear to me what needs to happen. Neither of the events happened in a vacuum. They are not isolated incidents and it looks like the 19 children who were needlessly slaughtered in Uvalde is also connected. I can't sit here in good faith and attempt to justify full access to gun purchases or ownership if school aged children will continue to be needlessly slaughtered.\n\nWhat is the connection? A mentally unstable person gained access to guns and sought to wreak as much destruction, as much pain, as much suffering as possible. It is unthinkable that in the modern day and age we are facing a problem that is so specific.\n\nIf you're pro gun, keep your weapons safely stored where access can only be gained by you and only you, this need not apply to you. It's time to regulate the sale of firearms through two ways:\n\n1) Registration. I don't want to hear it. You register your car, your ability to drive, your bank information, and your house with the government. Somehow guns are exempt from that status? \n\n2) Insurance. You must insure your weapons to guarantee their usage is safe and legal.\n\nThat's it. That's the rant.",

For example, the ACA put in provisions for pre-existing conditions and free preventative care. Despite all their bluster to overturn \"Obamacare\", every single one of them - Trump included - had to change their viewpoint on those provisions cuz once their base actually got a taste of it, it was a death sentence to take it away.\n\nPush through legal recreational marijuana, push through universal healthcare, push through free community college, push through free childcare service, etc. and once the masses experience the benefits they'll demand they never go away.",

Only one other officer ‚Äî Uvalde Police Department Lt. Mariano Pargas, who was the city‚Äôs acting police chief on the day of massacre ‚Äî is known to have been placed on leave for their actions during the shooting.  \n\nArredondo, who has been on leave from the district since June 22, has come under the most intense scrutiny of the nearly 400 officers who rushed to school but waited more than an hour to confront the 18-year-old gunman in a fourth-grade classroom.\n\nMost notably, Arredondo was criticized for not ordering officers to act sooner. Col. Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, has said Arredondo was in charge of the law enforcement response to the attack.\n\nArredondo was not in attendance with his career on the line.\n\nInstead, minutes before the meeting of the Uvalde school board got underway, Arredondo‚Äôs attorney released a scathing 4,500-word letter that amounted to the police chief‚Äôs fullest defense to date of his actions. Over 17 defiant pages, Arredondo is not the fumbling school police chief who a damning state investigation blamed for not taking command and wasted time by looking for keys to a likely unlocked door, but a brave officer whose level-headed decisions saved the lives of other students.  \n\nThe letter also accused Uvalde school officials of putting his life at risk by not letting him carry a weapon to the school board meeting.\n\n‚ÄúChief Arredondo is a leader and a courageous officer who with all of the other law enforcement officers who responded to the scene, should be celebrated for the lives saved, instead of vilified for those they couldn‚Äôt reach in time,‚Äù Hyde wrote.\n\nUvalde school officials have been under mounting pressure from victims‚Äô families and members of the community, many of whom have called for Arredondo‚Äôs termination. Superintendent Hal Harrell had first moved to fire Arredondo in July but postponed the decision at the request of the police chief‚Äôs attorney.  \n\nAmong those at the meeting was Ruben Torres, father of Chloe Torres, who survived the shooting in room 112 of the school. He said that as a former Marine, he took an oath that he faithfully executed willingly, and did not understand why officers did not take action when leadership failed.\n\n‚ÄúRight now, being young, she is having a hard time handling this horrific event,‚Äù Torres said.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety, which had more than 90 state troopers at the scene,¬†has also launched an internal investigation¬†into the response by state police.\n\nSchool officials have said the campus at Robb Elementary will no longer be used. Instead, campuses elsewhere in Uvalde will serve as temporary classrooms for elementary school students, not all of whom are willing to return to school in-person following the shooting.  \n\nSchool officials say a virtual academy will be offered for students. The district has not said how many students will attend virtually, but a new state law passed last year in Texas following the pandemic limits the number of eligible students receiving remote instruction to ‚Äú10% of all enrolled students within a given school system.‚Äù\n\nSchools can seek a waiver to exceed the limit but Uvalde has not done so, according to Melissa Holmes, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency.\n\nNew measures to improve school safety in Uvalde include ‚Äú8-foot, non-scalable perimeter fencing‚Äù at elementary, middle and high school campuses, according to the school district. Officials say they have also installed additional security cameras, upgraded locks, enhanced training for district staff and improving communication.  \n\nHowever, according to the district‚Äôs own progress reports, as of Tuesday no fencing had been erected at six of the eight campuses where it was planned, and cameras had only been installed at the high school. Some progress had been made on locks at three of eight campuses, and communication improvement was marked as half complete for each campus.\n\nUvalde CISD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBy¬†Acacia Coronado‚Äâ|‚ÄâAP\n\nAugust 24, 2022 at 8:31 p.m. EDT",

My dad was in Korea, and he made it clear to me that I was the man of the house while he was overseas. My brother got a paddling from his teacher that left him black and blue from the middle of his back, to half way to his knees for repeating a 3 Stooges joke he saw on TV.\n\n The teacher was calling on students to name a famous dam. When he called on my brother he said \"Giva Dam?\". He came home with a note saying he had been paddled, and when I saw the bruises I went ballistic. I pried the car keys from my mom's hands and drove with my brother back to the school to catch him before he left. I caught him in the parking lot.\n\n I showed him the bruises he left on my brother and asked him if he would prefer me calling the police, or if he was going to take it like a man. He squared off on me, and I broke his nose, jaw, and a few teeth. The only repercussions were the 3 stitches I  needed for cutting my knuckles on his teeth.\n\nEdit: My memory is slipping in my old age. I was 16 at the end of my junior year.

        "body": "In 7th grade, we had homework in English class where we had three sections to complete. The first two sections, you were supposed to write out and separate the subject and predicate of the sentence. The last section, you were supposed to only write the subject, but about half the class did it the same way as the other two because we didn't read the directions for each section. We showed that we understood the material, but it was still done incorrectly. The teacher was *pissed* that so many of us had not properly followed directions that she sent us all to ISS until we completed the homework the right way.\n\nWhen we get to ISS, we find that it was now over capacity. For any student sent to ISS that day, they pulled all the kids whose parents had signed the waivers where they could be paddled as an alternative. When they asked why we were in trouble and we told them we did our homework wrong, they didn't believe us - called us liars and paddled us anyway.\n\nWe get back to class and the teacher asks us for our completed homework. We tell her we don't have it, we didn't have time. She walks us directly down to the Principal's office thinking we were lying. The look on her face when they told her they paddled us was priceless. She felt terrible as that was never her intention.\n\nI had to take the paper home to get signed by my parents and instead, my mom went in the next day and revoked their ability to paddle my sister and I since they had shown not to exhibit any kind of reasonable judgment. Not doing your homework correctly should result in a poor mark, not corporal punishment.\n\nThis was maybe 1998/9 in Nashville. It might be better here now - I don't have kids or know anyone with them old enough, so I don't even know if they still do that.\n\n(I will say, though, that I'd take a paddling from that principal any day over my mom's yard stick. I think he was so scared to hit too hard that he relied on the fear factor more than the pain)",

They've had multiple mass shootings since the Port Arthur shooting. They also didn't exactly have a mass shooting problem before they passed their gun laws. They historically have had roughly 1-2 mass shootings a decade (both before and after Port Arthur). They're not actually a good example of \"they had lots of mass shootings, passes some laws, and now they have none\", simply because a) they didn't have much in the way of mass shootings to begin with, and b) the rate of mass shootings hasn't really changed much (though with how rare mass shootings are for them in the first place, there's very little data to determine what trends are present at all, it's literally just a handful of events scattered across as many decades).",

This is in contrast to the US, a place where literally anybody of legal age, including an awful lot of angry young men with a grudge and gangbangers who need to feel macho, can walk into a goddamn Walmart and leave with a weapon not at all dissimilar to those used by the military.\n\nBut that's beside the point. You can't claim something won't work without testing it. That's not how scientific inquiry works. And the reality is that everywhere in the world, places that have tighter restrictions on gun ownership have less gun deaths. It's an irrefutable fact.

So my mom fashioned a sort of wingsuit costume out of old bedsheets. Then she made a big triangular head out of some rigid construction paper and drew eyes on it, so he could sort of wear it as a hat.\n\nIt was a pretty good costume. Except the bedsheets she used were white. Solid white. So naturally, to match, she made the head out of white paper too. The issue then became that he needed to lift up the dino head to be able to see, wearing it on top of his head with the beaky part up at a point, as otherwise it was blinding and uncomfortable.\n\nIn all the photos from that night he looks *remarkably* like a tiny KKK member. Like more than a simple ghost costume would. And he went door to door like this. We've since mentioned this to our mom but I think she is in denial about it. \"No, he just looks so cute! He wanted that costume so badly!\" \n\nOur neighborhood back then was about 99.9% white, so perhaps crisis was averted.",

There was an excellent documentary called [Shoah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoah_\\(film\\)) where civilian (and government) contemporary eyewitnesses were interviewed. This includes the person who was proud of creating the efficient schedules for the death trains. The locals knew but were powerless to stop it even if they wanted to do anything. However, many didn't want to help due to anti-semitism and some personally benefitted from Jews being removed (ex: Jewish homes went to Polish locals).

However, I wouldn't say the attack dismantled our naval control because our real sea power - the carriers - were not in the port during the attack. There's even a conspiracy theory that the US government knew about the upcoming attack which is why they moved a lot of the newer equipment out of the port. I'm not a subscriber to the theory but it's not like we lost our entire fleet.

A lot of the ideology came from the US. For instance, eugenics and support for Nazi's came from pretty prominent people at the time. Hitler adopted some of the views - the anti-semitism, the eugenics, the superiority complex, etc. After the war - with the discovery of the genocide - Nazi views became extremely unpopular. They were popular only with the other failed group with a superiority complex - the racist South (ex: KKK). That's why you often see those racists being allied with the Nazi's and they simply grew in prominence recently considering the resurgence of the far right ideas in the US in recent years.",

Scores of thousands ‚Äì literally scores of thousands ‚Äì of executions in cold blood are being perpetrated by the German police-troops upon the Russian patriots who defend their native soil. Since the Mongol invasions of Europe in the sixteenth century, there has never been methodical, merciless butchery on such a scale, or approaching such a scale.\"\n\n* In 1942, the World Jewish Congress released a report in the United States that the Nazis were planning on rounding up every Jew in their occupied territory and exterminating them, probably using poison gas.\n\n* In early 1942, the Daily Telegraph and the BBC published stories detailing reports from the Polish government-in-exile that Jews were being rounded up and exterminated, and that an estimated 700,000 had already been killed\n\n* By the end of 1942, the Polish government-in-exile sent a detailed report of the atrocities to allied governments, and the allies released a joint statement confirming and condemning the holocaust. This statement was read to the House of Commons in the UK.\n\n* In 1943, Witoli Pilecki, an officer of the defeated Polish army, sent a report to Allied governments detailing the atrocities at the death camps from which he escaped.\n\n* Both Roosevelt and Churchill had received ongoing and detailed reports of the atrocities, along with pressure to take in Jewish refugees and bomb Nazi death camp infrastructure. Both the US and UK actively tried to prevent refugees from being accepted into each respective country. In spite of detailed intelligence on Auschwitz infrastructure and pressure from the American Jewish community to bomb it, Roosevelt refused to authorize any action against the German death camp infrastructure. \n\nThe information was there. The allies first refused to accept that it was happening, and then they accepted it was happening and refused to do anything about it. The information was there, Jewish groups were lobbying the allies, exiled Poles were lobbying the allies, it was in the press, but nobody really cared or wanted to do anything. \n\nIt's a very convenient narrative to say that we didn't know until after we liberated the camps. It allows us to believe that *had we only known, we could have done something.* Well we did know, our government knew, and they did nothing.",

I also work in education so I have some experience in these matters.\n\n&gt; &gt;  ‚ÄúAs much as the parents want this case to be about a ‚Äògun,‚Äô it is, rather, a case about classroom disruption from **a student who has had a long history of disruptive behavior and for whom the school had attempted a list of other strategies and interventions before resorting to a suspension.**‚Äù\n\nThis boy was not suspended because he made a Pop Tart shaped gun. He was suspended for repeated behavioral issues. The suspension was being used to help send a message to the student  and his parents (which clearly fell on deaf ears). Before a student is suspended in elementary school, especially a 2nd grader, there is always going to use multiple behavior management tools before the decision to suspend a kid occurs. These behavior management tools can be very effective if the parents are involved in the process too.\n\n&gt; &gt; The boy‚Äôs behavior in school is detailed in a 30-page document that shows a pattern of threatening other students and even **throwing chairs at his classmates**.\n\n30 pages of behavioral documentation is a lot for a 7 year old to have. Part of this documentation was most likely documenting the various behavioral management techniques they tried to help him too.\n\n&gt; &gt; In the findings of facts, Joshua is said to have **punched a fellow student in the nose, which led to a one-day suspension**\n\nAgain, this was not a first time incident and a 7 year demonstrating aggressive behavior clearly needs help, which is a part of the parents job to recognize and get. \n\n&gt; &gt; Nussbaum (the hearing examiner overseeing the parents appeal of the suspension) said he was convinced that ‚Äúhad the student chewed his cereal bar into the shape of a cat and ran around the room, disrupting the classroom and making ‚Äòmeow‚Äô cat sounds, the result would have been exactly the same.‚Äù\n\nI agree with Nussbaum's assessment that it didn't matter what the student created with the Pop Tart it was about the consistent behavioral issues. \n\nIt is also clear that these behavioral issues weren't being taken seriously at home.\n\n&gt; &gt;The father said he was told the day that the boy was suspended that it was for playing as if he had a gun, not for ongoing problems.\n\nBecause the previous suspension wasn't alarming enough for the father? This is what I call a red flag for bad parenting. \n\n&gt; &gt; Nussbaum also said he found it troubling that **the family allowed news media to attend the student‚Äôs hearing**\n\nThere is the nice cherry on top. The parents clearly realized that if the \"play gun\" argument they would get the fanatic gun advocates here to help create extra pressure on the school system. Please note: I have nothing against guns or gun owners. I own many, but I still recognize the lunatic fringe of gun culture and these parents were using the media to help stir the crazy pot to garner support. \n\nSo now we have other states passing laws against this to stop those damn \"liberal commie socialist\" teachers from stopping kids from having fun! What is really happening now is that politicians are now creating laws that will further undermine the autonomy schools and teachers should have when dealing with students. \n\n(Here is my liberally biased opinion) I personally find it hilarious that states like Texas and Florida have passed laws against suspensions for \"Pop Tart guns\". These same states elect Republicans who blame minority parents, particularly ones who live in low socioeconomic areas, for their troubled kids. Yet they won't acknowledge that the parents, not the school, failed this child.\n\nNow, are there incidences where schools may use conduct policies to go too far? Absolutely, but this was not one of the cases. \n\nSources: [[1]](http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2014/07/01/ruling-goes-against-boy-in-the-pop-tart-case/), [[2]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/hearing-examiner-backs-suspension-of-boy-who-chewed-pastry-into-gun-shape/2014/06/30/f3aee730-004b-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html), [[3]](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/examiner-recommends-school-board-uphold-pop-tart-suspension/)\n\nTL;DR: This issue was never about a \"Pop Tart gun\". This case was about bad parents who are unwilling to accept their son's problems and because of that they were (most likely) unwilling to help aid in behavioral management too. ",

In order to sustain a language program (I'm a Japanese language teacher so I'm very well aware), you must both keep up new enrollment *and* keep students enrolled. Especially for a dual language program because students can't enroll later into the language. \n\nIf everyone starts at 1st grade in DL Chinese and you start getting kids trickling out every year then you will get VERY tiny class sizes by 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade. Kids can't join the program because they've missed several years of language exposure, and you're not going to \"catch up\" to a language like Chinese quickly.\n\nKeeping the program then means increasing the class sizes of the non-DL teachers. And it's never fair when you're in a class of 26 4th graders and a colleague has 13.\n\nThe district should have imposed either a rule of \"once you're in DL, you REMAIN in DL until you leave the school\" and also used the interim time to examine WHY students are leaving and what can be done to increase retention. DL programs have to be planned out extremely carefully, otherwise they definitely will collapse in on themselves.",

Most people need to work during the day and the institution of school allows for a baseline of education, food, safety, care, and shelter during that time.  We can't flip a switch and change this dynamic across hundreds of millions of parents.\n\nMy question is why we view the job as diminutive; these things are very important and not easy to provide.  Teachers, and especially teachers of young children, are key to keeping business running enough to mitigate job loss within our communities in addition to the \"normal\" job of shaping future generations.  I would rather be subsidising teachers than cruise companies with my tax dollars during this time.",

Do we send our kid to school? Can we risk our safety? Can we afford to keep our child at home? What if the school officials dont agree with my world view? They cant make kids wear masks/what if they dont make kids wear masks? \n\nMeanwhile, Theyve made doctors and nurses vilified and science mystical paganism so much that professionals are quitting our already most expensive medical feild in the world. With less and less doctors working, healthcare will be even more expensive making it less accessible to many. \n  \nWe're going to get that situation with teachers too. Ive heard local complaints that the rich counties are doing homeschool with school issued ipads, meanwhile inner city schools are again playing \"do we turn on the heat today\" game. Combine that with the trend for working from home, specifically available to higher class jobs, and you might start seeing how all this plays out down the road.",

Now...When cases are rising and we're nearing the normal cold/flu season, talk about the worst most tone-deaf timing.  And to top it all off, the school released their \"detailed\" plans, and they are only asking their faculty and staff to be tested once every 30 days.  \n\nTesting once a month...is not even pretending like you want to catch cases as they happen.  Once a month is basically a cover-your-ass to say that you have a testing requirement in your opening plans.\n\nIt's such a joke, and it's so absurd how no one anywhere has the practical resources to get a handle on the pandemic in the USA in any meaningful way.\n\nIndoor consumer operations should be 100% not allowed.  I don't give a fuck if you're organized sports or a gym or a restaurant.\n\nThere was an article I read about how many areas in Germany is handling it; indoor dining and indoor businesses are generally never reopened.  But in-person learning has always been happening (because the education systems believed that distance learning was not feasible to provide adequate education).  Pods in schools do not mix people all, even with the instructors (enough instructors are hired to support the needed student: teacher ratio to have one instructor for each pod). And schools are testing frequently enough that they can catch cases as they happen and the pods of classes can isolate easily.  There have been a handful of cases, but there weren't ever any spreader events, it was all well contained.  Which has allowed most adults who work to be able to continue to go to work and prevent halts to the local and national economies.\n\n What we're doing here is just embarrassing.",

The one child policy also meant that they pour all of their love and resources into one kid. \n\nKilling a kid in China is the ultimate stab at society, you not only hurt more people (all the victims relatives) but you also waste all the resources invested into the kid, and effectively demolish the parents' futures.",

She got out and blamed him for scratching her car. He told her it wasn't his fault. She slapped him couple times in th face and he pushed her back and got her dress dirty. So she went home and told her dad who is super rich. So the dad comes down with couple of friends and beats the shit ouf of the bike repair guy tells him to go to the atm and get 25000 rmb to pay for the damages. Guy got no choice and gave up his life savings. But guess wasn't enough. So the rich dad threatened to fuck up his wife and kid. So the dude lost it a couple of days later. Camped out stabbed the girl to death when she was getting into her car. Killed the dad and mom when they came out to see what happened. All happened in broad day light. Then he sat there covered in blood waited for the cops to show up. Dude ended up getting the death sentence.  Chinese people are shallow as fuck. Once they get rich they don't give a fuck. Every see the video of the rich family smashing up the airport cause their flight got canceled.  It's like that.

Today it's more difficult now because if the Era of the cell phone and internet, and Chinese government doesnt want its people too look like savages to the rest of the world (social point system) but you can still get away with murder.

However, the K-2 schools only had a parade while the 3-5 ones didn't.\n\n*Then* the two different schools became reconfigured under one system, Pk-5. Under the new system, the administration had to figure out a way to consolidate Halloween festivities so that kids wouldn't be left out. These included:\n\n1. Kids unable to afford a costume and showing up to school feeling ashamed or embarrassed\n2. Kids whose parents worked during the day and weren't able to join up with their kids to participate in a Halloween event taking place in school hours\n3. Kids whose parents wouldn't allow them to attend Halloween festivities\n\nSo the school district said, \"No problem. We'll *drop the parade* that the K-2 school used to have during school hours, and create a brand new Halloween event that takes place *after school hours*--in the evening. Now kids who can't afford a costume can come to the event anyway (since costumes aren't required). Kids whose parents work in the daytime can finally have their parents join them at the event, and kids whose parents don't allow them to participate in Halloween don't have to worry about showing up to school every year and being shamed or ridiculed for not celebrating Halloween.\"\n\nApparently, the parents in Milford threw a temper tantrum because they lost the parade, so they started smearing the school district as trying to \"ban Halloween\", when all it did was drop the parade in favor of an evening event.

One of them is to decrease the stigma towards mental illness.

A person with a narrative cannot be questioned, they aren't there for discussion. They're there to tell a story. We don't get to argue with the screen at the cinema, right? Same thing. That's a narrative.\n\nAnd this narrative is one that's become very clearly influenced by political agendas, not a want for safety. Fact is this story isn't about a 'mass shooting' or 'school shooting'. It's a worker dispute that got violent. Small-town story, national news now. Welcome to America.\n\nAmerican gun violence is a statistical anomaly because Americans are legally allowed to own guns. Compared to other nations, you're right, that's anomalous. So is freedom of speech and other expression in a lot of ways. I am perfectly fine with these anomalies.\n\nGuns are deadly tools. You're right. So are cars. By a much larger margin. Guns are not intended to be used by 99.99% of gun owners. They are *in case of need*. The numbers back this up. And in those numbers, you'd see that the rate of accidental deaths is about 14x lower than that of automobiles, even after accounting for per-capita use. Automobiles are far deadlier than firearms. But \"we need those\" right? No we don't. We could fundamentally change our nation such that no, we don't. \n\nBut who wants to put in that much effort, right? So why is it okay to demand only one group, a 1/3rd of America, to fundamentally alter *their* lifestyle \"for all of us\", when 99.99% of them are completely benign and responsible gun owners? Remember too that those guns *cost money*. You want to tell a bunch of innocent citizens who did nothing wrong \"sorry, but we're confiscating all that and not paying you back\". And you expect that might be fair? \n\n\"But but but cars aren't *intended to kill anyone!!!*\" So what? They can, quite easily and at a rate of 14x more than firearms, when used improperly. So can guns. What's the difference? Absolutely nothing. Except fear mongering by the media and people on reddit. \n\nBut no, let's not talk \"*all* guns\", why not just ARs? \n\nBecause that's like removing Hummers from the road and declaring the problem of climate change to be solved. By the numbers, ARs aren't even a tenth as deadly as handguns. But no one's saying we should take the handguns out of the hands of women who use them to defend themselves from rape at a reported rate of over 200,000+ a year. Same handguns cause that 75%+ of all firearms-related homicides. \n\n\nAnd I like gun control. I think we should have *much, much* harsher gun control. But flying this \"narrative\" at every instance of a gun being improperly used is fear mongering with a motive; it's manipulative and dishonest. Imagine that we reported *every single fatal traffic incident* that was the result of someone driving badly, in the national news. There'd be nothing else to talk about. We couldn't even *get* to all those cases. 102 people a day. 2000 children under 16 die every year from it. So where are the demands to stop *that*? Where's *that* narrative? \n\n\nFeel free to ask for sources on anything I've said here. If you're willing to have a civil discussion, I'm happy to oblige.",

IF you don't understand that, then you should learn some math.\n\nI do understand that; that's *why they're 14x as deadly when looking at accidental death statistics*. But no one's up in arms over that. 2000 children under 16 killed *every year*. That's over 4x as many *kids* killed each year by accidental and improper use of a car then *all the victims* of mass shootings, dead or not, annually.

The NRA. They co-authored the first (and most important) federal gun control legislation in America. \n\nMagazine limits are ineffective. Fort Hood's shooter used a revolver and another handgun. It was the deadliest mass shooting on a military base in US history, and it took only minutes. But sure, let's just use only revolvers. You'll still have shootings, some will be very deadly. But sure, let's make every gun no more than 10 rounds. You'll just sell more magazines. \n\nWe have waiting periods, we have background checks. Yes the \"private sale\" loophole is an issue, but that won't go away by making every part of a gun go through NICS. Because criminals are still gonna criminal. \n\nIt is already a law that states guns must be locked up when not in use. You can't legislate irresponsible and stupid away. Bump stocks aren't the cause of any real problem at all, and you can do the same exact thing with a standard stock and a belt loop. \n\nI do support public research into gun violence. We already do a *metric ton* but sure, more can't hurt. I'd like to see a focus on mental health and *understanding firearms*, instead of just being *afraid* of them. \n\nI think most of your ideas are feel-good measures, not really effective to the purpose of decreasing gun violence. I mean we had an assault weapons ban for years and gun violence we *up* during that period. If you really want to tackle gun crime, you have to make gun crime a much harsher crime. Sell a weapon illegally to a person who uses it for a murder? You're going down for the same felony murder. Not a firearm charge, a murder rap. Or attempted murder, depending on the case. I think that'd be a big deterrent from the typical \"2A freedom\" types who think they're doing the lord's work by distributing illegal firearms. \n\nI think a person who accidentally discharges a firearm in their home should have their children forcibly taken from them. State custody. Plus mandatory sentencing, say, 3 years. If a kid gets ahold of your gun and discharges it, 10 years + whatever else if that kid tragically kills anyone. I mean *seriously harsh* regulations, that's what I want. I want mandatory annual certification classes, in both shooting and safety. If you own a gun, you need to be *more than capable* of using it. Not just understand it, you need to be *skilled*. \n\nMost people on your side of the argument aren't willing to push quite this hard. Which is exactly why I am as exhaustive as I'm being: The discussion is more than just quips and jabs thrown at people, it's *actually serious*. We should treat it like that. \n\nI don't particularly care about arming teachers or not, either, because they're citizens. I know for a fact that a not-insignificant number of teachers have been quietly carrying at school for many, many years. I trust teachers more than I trust people in most other professions.

Don't believe it if you have a team teacher meeting and they say we will out a stop to it. We have no power. There is very little we can do except rely on admin. Admin can suspend them, but is discourage by the powers above for suspensions. So they generally won't. I got in trouble once (well worth it) because I privately called the parents of a kid who had his bully put a plastic bag over his head in the hallway (yes, he actually put a bag over this poor kids head and tightened it. Attempted murder, right?!)\nAnyway, once the bully came back after 3 days of suspension, I called the parents to let them know the would-be murderer was once again walking the halls alongside their son. For some idiotic reason, there is a shroud of secrecy around a bully's punishment. All the parents were told is that the problem had been taken care of. Honestly, I think they assumed the kid had been expelled (as he should have been; not his first attempt to harm or kill that kid). Anyway, I went ahead and violated the attempted murderers right to privacy and told the other set of parents what his punishment was. Wisely, after out phone call the parents pulled both their kids from our school and put them into private school. Somebody put two and two together (I was outspoken about my displeasure over the attempted murder that occured in our 7th grade hallway, as anyone should be) and figured out I told the parents the truth. Got written up and I took a lot of enjoyment out of penning an addendum to that write up explaining the circumstances of my \"violating a students confidentiality\".

I was untouchable because my mom was the 8th grade history teacher, but when the band director couldn't keep an eye on all 50 of us, Kyle would terrorize others.   He had a little tiny razor blade he taped on a pen that he'd cut things with, slap or punch others when the teacher didn't see.   I saw him take scissors and cut off part of a girl's pony tail.  Another time I saw him throw bleach on someone. There was another kid in the class named Ethan, that Kyle picked on restlessly.   Ethan was the first kid I met in class and was just a gentle soul.  Super friendly and nice.\n\nOne day there was a 6th grade only assembly and the band director had to walk us across campus to the auditorium.  And I could see Kyle was hellbent on attacking Ethan when we left.  Ethan confided in me before we left, \"Kyle's gonna hurt me. I don't know what to do.\"  We leave class and I hung back.  My mom had a free class and was in her classroom and on the way to the auditorium I hung back and dashed in her class.  I remember telling her, \"Mom, Kyle xxxx is gonna hurt Ethan bad, you've gotta go walk by the band room and just check.\"  I was almost in tears, but she calmed me some and said she'd walk over.   She did, and found Kyle with his hands around Ethan's shirt collar, up against a wall, with that razor blade pen in his hand.   Immediately Kyle backed off and said they were playing.   Mom informed the band director what happened when she \"accidentally\" came to the band room to ask him a question.  Kyle got a shitty week of detention but it saved Ethan. \n\nSo what happened to them?\n\nKyle, dropped out of school eventually with a long string of aggravated assaults, drug dealing, burglary.  One day he tried robbing a person who shot back.  Kyle jumped in his car, wounded, and crashed into a tree and it caught on fire.

Those were all the \"inventive\" games; most of the time kids were just intentionally clogging the toilets. Even if I had wanted to ruin a pair of shoes by walking through a pond of piss, I wouldn't have been able to wipe my ass because they installed these toilet-paper dispensers that wouldn't let you grab more than a square at a time.\n\nNo joke, one day the janitor stormed out of the school, simply yelling \"I quit!\" Afterwards there was someone that had to stand outside the bathroom door and take down your name and time when you entered.

Our once top notch schools, where it took years to get in for an interview, are now facing a teacher shortage after Gov. Walker screwed us over. No one wants to work under impossible constraints where there's no money to get the outcomes they expect and demand. Aides were cut, nurses were cut, social workers were cut, even freaking librarians were cut, supplies became the teacher's responsibility while their own pay was slashed, insurance coverage was reduced but came with a higher price tag, copays, etc..Behavioral issues were HUGE as support staff was cut, special ed assistants cut, janitorial positions cut, etc.. And all the while, standards being set with the district NOT using known, best practices for outcomes. It was a lose-lose situation and teachers have left. Most of the teachers I know who left spoke of feeling like they were getting to a point of being unprofessional and left the kitchen before it got too hot.\n\nHOWEVER, I never witnessed teachers being horrible to students like this story covers. There was a climate that allowed these teachers to get to this point. In all the schools I worked at, I never once saw teachers mistreating kids to this degree. And there was a heavy culture among staff and teachers nipping any concerns with new teachers in the bud. Maybe it's the district I worked for, but questionable handling of students was reported and dealt with very swiftly. The climate of the school was one of zero tolerance. Substitute teachers were usually the cause of concerns. Unskilled, out of practice subs, unfamiliar with the standard of professionalism of the district.",

But it's hard to say what *the* base issue is, since it really has become so convoluted. It seems like better health care and gun control should be the answer. It should have been the answer a long time ago. Unfortunately the gun lobby is huge in the States and has prevented a great deal of functioning gun control to pass. \n\nAs far as the culture is concerned there's this weird polarization between \"gun nuts\" and \"liberals.\" Gun nuts want their constitutional rights to bear arms, citing the Second Amendment ad nauseum. Liberals want there to be little to no access to guns, especially the AK-47s. I personally am confused as to why it needs to be such an argument as to reach a stalemate every time. Safety of the populace should come first. \n\nI think the best place to start with searching for a solution to any problem is to just start an intelligent conversation about what really needs to be discussed. In the instance of gun violence, unfortunately, the buck has always been passed to violent films, video games, and music. It's silly. It's like blaming the weather for someone getting punched in the face. Then there are the ever-present slippery-slope and straw man arguments like \"guns don't kill people,\" and \"cars have killed people, why don't we outlaw those?\" and \"well if we all had guns then someone would've shot that guy and stopped him!\" and other such fallacies that fail to contribute to any working solution.\n\nSo, there are so many different facets, cultural and otherwise, that seem contribute to this quagmire. I personally would like it all to stop and for gun control to be tightened so I don't have to seize up in fear every time I go to class or work. ",

That brings the total number of children killed by this tornado to at least 40, and adults to at least 51. \n\n**EDIT 24:** CNN once again reporting that the office of the state's Chief Medical Examiner has stated that they believe the death toll to be at least 91.\n\n**EDIT 23:** CNN now reporting once again that the official death toll is still 51 with the other 40 unconfirmed, so we'll go for 51 unless we hear anything else confirmed by an official source.\n\n**EDIT 22:** The official death toll is now **91 people** who have been killed in this tragedy. That is expected to rise further.\n\n**EDIT 21:** Current reports have 145 people in hospital and at least 233 injured.\n\n**EDIT 20:**  Contrary to previous reports, officials say that the operation at the school is still search and RESCUE, i.e., they still hope to find trapped people alive in the rubble.  Let's hope they do.\n\n**EDIT 19:** I haven't updated for a while because there just doesn't seem to be much going on with the school that can be called an update.  No further survivors or victims pulled from the rubble, but emergency workers are working through the night to find anyone they can, living or dead.\n\n**EDIT 18:** State Medical Examiner's Office confirms that the death toll stands at 51, with at least 20 of those being children. The death toll is expected to rise.\n\n**EDIT 17:** KFOR reporting that ALL students at Briarwood Elementary School are now accounted for and have survived. One bit of good news for the night. \n\n**EDIT 16:** Officials confirm that there are still 24 children missing at Plaza Towers Elementary. Little information being revealed about the situation at Briarwood at present, please comment below if you know more.\n\n**EDIT 15:** There have been no survivors found at Plaza Towers Elementary in the last two hours. (Gary Tuchman on the phone to CNN)\n\n**EDIT 14:** It is now fully dark in OKC which is hampering rescue and recovery efforts. The number of reported deaths still stands at 51. Industrial floodlights have been brought into the main areas that emergency workers are focusing on.\n\n**EDIT 13:** [The BBC has pictures of children being rescued from the rubble of Plaza Towers Elementary.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22605020) - It should be noted that these are from earlier today, and that first responders have stated that sadly they are now in a recovery, as opposed to rescue, mission.\n\n**EDIT 12:** Associated Press twitter feed reports that at least 120 people are being treated in hospitals, including 70+ children.\n\n**EDIT 11:** At least seven children were found drowned in a pool of water at the bottom of Plaza Towers school. Another 20-30 missing.\n\n**EDIT 10:** I'm back online, many thanks to those who replied to this thread with updates as it allowed me to keep up to date on my phone. \n\nAt present news reports are saying at least 51 people dead and that number is expected to rise. 20-30 people presumed dead at Plaza Towers Elementary School. Utterly horrifying news.\n\n**EDIT 9:** Cries for help heard from inside the Plaza Towers school wreckage, according to CNN.\n\n**EDIT 8:** CNN reports that the school confirms it has not yet accounted for all the children. No further numbers available at this time.\n\n**EDIT 7:** Aerial footing appears to show first responders focusing on one particular point of the wreckage at the moment. There is speculation that there are trapped people underneath.\n\n**EDIT 6:** CNN reporter says it looks like first responders are talking to someone trapped under the rubble. At least one dog has been brought to the school to help.\n\n**EDIT 5:** CNN affiliate reporter saying that kids describe a teacher laying on top of other children to try to protect them. The kids interviewed were told to hold onto the walls.\n\n**EDIT 4:** Aerial footage showing rescue workers crawling over the wreckage at the school with bright yellow backboards. No images or news of any rescues yet. The 3rd grade class were apparently sheltering in a hallway when the tornado hit, and much of the current rescue operation is apparently centered on finding them.\n\n**EDIT 3:** CNN reporting that 4th, 5th &amp; 6th graders all accounted for and are sheltering at a church near the school. The kindergarteners, 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd graders were sheltering in the destroyed parts of the school, and it is those children who the rescue efforts are centered on.  I am the parent of a kindergartener (NOT at this school, thank God) and I am filled with horror at this development.\n\n**EDIT 2:** They are also reporting that the tornado was \"at least two miles wide\".\n\n**EDIT:** They are now reporting that 30 children have been pulled out alive from the school.\n\n\nCNN is reporting that 75 children were inside the parts of Plaza Towers Elementary School that are destroyed. Witnesses report that one child has emerged alive so far.",

These places, like places that are struck by hurricanes, DO have regulations that help protect against an 'average' tornado.\n\nSadly, you can't design for everything. I would contend, the cost of building such a structure aside, that you'd be hard pressed to find building materials that could withstand the raw power a tornado of this strength possesses. Keep in mind - this is easily in the top 1% of storms - and you just can't plan for that outlier. Maybe if you built entirely out of reenforced concrete set 20 feet into the ground, with double thick windows and a steel door - but that sounds like a bomb shelter to me, not a house.\n\nWhat a lot of families do - and what my cousins did after a tornado during the 1999 outbreak passed less than a mile from them - is they reenforced one room in their house with reenforced concrete. Basically, the house could be blown away and this room should (hopefully) remain intact. They've never had to use it to my knowledge, but it's some peace of mind.",

        "body": "This is a long read but I need to get this off my chest. This is my first hand encounter from ground zero. Sorry for making this one long paragraph. I am fairly manic right now and need to vent. \n\nI have included this album which is some pictures from the doorway of the CVS and some pictures I took while walking around helping people. http://imgur.com/a/XAzh6\n\nToday was literally the most traumatic day I have ever had. I live in Moore, Oklahoma. Today my city was hit by what they are projecting as the deadliest tornado in recorded history. At around 4:30PM I was taking a nap and heard thunder. There were warnings the last few days that the storms projected for my area might be severe. I got up and turned on the news. Sure enough they were saying there was a tornado building intensity and it was literally heading straight for me. \n\nI live in an apartment complex on the second floor so I packed a bag and went to find shelter. A grabbed my keys and ran outside. By the look of things, I decided I didn't have much time. I ended up going to the convenience store (CVS for you Americans) next door to get in the freezer since it's basically a giant steel box. I made it to the store and the manager was extremely frantic about to have a heart attack. He was rushing everyone to the back which was a terrible idea as there was little to no protection vs being in the freezer. Somewhere within a few minutes of being there it started to hail and the wind picked up. For those of you that don't know what hail is, it is basically frozen rain that turns into ice chunks and they can get big. This hail was about golf ball size. I decided to go to the back and calm everyone down. My mom called me frantically wondering where I was because she was watching on the news that the tornado had got quite large and was heading right for me. I told her my plan and she told me to get in my car and drive as fast as possible away because there is no way i'd survive if I didn't get to a proper shelter. I told her to calm down as I had no choice but to stay. My phone cut out and wouldn't dial out. \n\nThe power then went out and everyone started to freak out. The only light in this small room was the light from a few cell phones. I tried to calm them down as much as I could but they were hysterical. There was little to no protection in the room we were in. There was a lady with a baby and I made sure she got the best protection by forcing her under a sink. I know it sounds bad but that was literally the best thing she could have done. My mom then called me again and said to get to somewhere safe as it should be hitting me within a few seconds and then the phone cut out again. I stayed calm. At around 5PM the wind began to get louder and louder. We had a radio going and our local weather/news man Mike Morgan said something along the lines of \"This is an established F4 tornado! If you are not underground you need to be! You are not safe unless you are underground!\" At that moment like it was straight out of a movie, the building started to shake. The wind was so loud. Imagine the sound of a massive waterfall combined with a train. Now I wasn't too worried until then but just hearing that come from the radio as a tornado was simultaneously rolling over the top of me put something in prospective. I remember looking around the room with the little light I had wondering what I would try to hold on to when the roof was surely ripped off. Sure enough the wind got progressively louder and louder and the ceiling started to lift and drop back down making a loud bang each time. About 10 times of this and the wind died down a bit. After a good minute it was completely calm. I ran out of the make shift shelter to see if I could get a glimpse of what nearly put an end to me. Yes I know large storms have an eye to them and I could have been right in the middle of it but that wasn't the case. As I got to the front of the store I noticed a ton of lumber and debris had blown through the glass windows. I ran past the debris and went outside to see the tornado absolutely destroying the neighborhood across the street from me. It was mezmerizing. \n\nIt looked like it was moving in slow motion slowly away from me. Imagine a snow globe being shaken up the specs in it floating around and around in circles very slow. Imagine those specs being bricks and large pieces of lumber. 1.5 miles wide they said. I waited until it was out of site and went outside a bit further. I noticed every car I saw in the parking lot had every window completely broken out and missing. I could see the businesses across the street were demolished. Every few inches on the ground was some piece of someones house be it a brick, some type of wood, dishes, whatever a home consists of. These homes were hundreds of feet away. Within a few minutes a guy came stumbling across the street with 2 small dogs. He was cut up and saying he didn't know where his wife and kids were. I ran into the store and got him some water and watched his dogs while he calmed down a bit. I told him to hang in there and keep hope. I started to hear people yelling so I ran across the street to help. Nothing could ever prepare someone for what it looked like. \n\nOnce miles and miles of brick and wood homes were now either completely gone or demolished for as far as I could see. Cars and trees were in people bedrooms. Cars and fences in trees. Dogs running wild and scared. The smell of natural gas fumes. A house was in flames. I knew at any minute the whole place could explode but I've lived a good life and want to make sure others got to as well. I ran in and started tearing apart homes and yelling if anyone was trapped. Every time I found someone I flagged down emergency personnel and went to the next house to find another. Most everyone I found was ok or had minor injuries. Most. There is one lady that will never leave my memories and that is all I will say about that. After 2 sheets and a makeshift cross we moved on. \n\nShortly after I found a kid probably 10 years old aimlessly walking around looking for his dog. I asked him where his parents were and he was frantic about his dog. I asked him where he lived and he pointed to a pile of debris and started to run towards it. He was screaming the dogs name, Molly I think. Amazingly after a few seconds I heard barking from under a large pile of wood. I ran up to the top of it and started ripping it apart. Out poked Molly's head! Hooray! As I removed a few more boards I got a bad site. Molly had a bad cut on her side. The kid saw it and started crying. Luckily dogs are generally happy creatures no matter what happens to them and this dog had a giant smile so I used that as fuel and told the kid the dog just has a small scrape and shes a super dog. Thankfully he seemed to agree and started laughing. I didn't want the kid to be alone so I decided to make him feel like a hero and told him to help me go house to house finding people until I could find some police to hand him over to. Within a few minutes I heard a lady yelling the kids name and running towards him. It was his mom and I've never seen someone so happy in my life. \n\nI got a move on and found a few more people before almost passing out from the gas fumes and exhaustion from skipping breakfast and sleeping through lunch. As I was headed back to the CVS store, it was a very eerie experience. People were walking around like zombies. They were just in a daze. I walked by a local news team and had my head down saying 'its terrible, its all gone'. They asked to do an interview. I was in too much of a daze to do anything like that. I just kept walking. I went to my apartment and made some food. While eating I walked around to assess the damage. My ceiling is ripped up. There are broad boards stuck into my walls like arrows. My windows are completely broken out. I wont have water or power for weeks if not a month or longer. Not sure where to put this but I just remember I stepped on so many nails today.I took some vitamins and got some motivation and ran back out. I met up with a Red Cross member and asked if I could help. He gave me a case of water and told me to hand it out. I walked a few miles doing so. I went back to my apartment and grabbed as many cold beers, blankets and towels as I could and went back out. I handed them out with the rest of my water bottles. The look on people face cracking a can and taking a big drink after losing everything will forever be ingrained in my memory. It was starting to get dark and the national guard and police officers were kicking people out of the area as they didn't want looters (people stealing from others homes). I snuck around and helped as much as I could and when I felt I couldn't do much more I went back to my apartment and loaded up my car to head to my parents for a few weeks. Btw my car went from brand new to looking like it got in a fight with Mike Tyson and lost horribly. Windows and tires are fine but it's got giant dents all around. My parents live roughly 15 minutes from me. With all the debris in the roads/down power poles and power lines/police blockades, it took me 3 hours to get there. The president has declared this a Major National Disaster. I'm now watching my local news and the newscaster just summed it up very well, it looks like they took the entire city and put it in a giant blender and dumped it back out. I thank everyone for reading this.\n\nedited to break into paragraphs. still terrible formatting but i cant think straight atm. i'm so beat but i'm absolutely wired. i keep thinking i hear sirens fading in and out just outside my window. sorry guys, i tried.\n\n",

It is easily one of the most beautiful looking movie theaters I have been in.

As you can see, the decorations were damaged heavily, but it is structurally intact, for the most part. There was a bowling alley directly next to it that was completely destroyed. Not even it's foundations are left. It is one of two major buildings that were in the path of the tornado and survived, the other being the hospital. Even as I type this, it is being used as the command post for search and recovery.\n\nThis building, originally built just to be a place to pay for overpriced food and drinks and watch movies that you could find on the internet a week later, has suddenly become one of the few beacons of light in a devestated town. This builiding, built only to impress, has suddenly done it's job better than anyone could have thought. Hospitals are built to be sturdy, so that they can support patients for as long as possible. But this movie theater just faced down an F5 tornado, quite possibly the worst twister ever, and *won*.\n\nYears later, when the town is rebuilt or rebuilding, The Warren and the hospital will be the only remnants of the old town. It's a powerful testament to human engineering that these buildings were able to survive. From now on, they will be remembered as memories of how the town used to be, and how so many people were able to survive and bounce back.",

Because if people are prohibited from keeping and bearing arms, how can they form a well regulated militia?\n\nSo hopefully this is enough to convince you that you're wrong. The state does not form a militia, the people do. Not sure where you're even getting that idea. And a militia is made up of people who have the right to keep and bear their arms.

It didn't need to be said because it's obvious that's why you would want to repel domestic invaders (aka an over-reaching federal army). \n\n&gt;  and it wasn't in the first Congress Debate on Arms and Militia\n\nThe concept of militia very much included a facet of allowing the states to defend themselves against a Federal army. There was definitely debate about this in the context of state militias vs federal government:\n\n&gt;  Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the F≈ìderal Government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State Governments, with the People on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by Governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\n\n[source](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3AFederalist%2C_Dawson_edition%2C_1863.djvu/475)\n\nThe idea of militias as a means of providing security against centralized federal tyranny is deeply rooted in the origins of the 2nd Amendment, even if it's not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution.\n\n",
