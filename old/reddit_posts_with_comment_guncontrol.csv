vdy1xy,"How to stop school shootings, while keeping the second amendment; a European’s perspective",whomstd-ve,1,2022-06-16T22:42:16,"A lot of the gun legislation I’ve seen being proposed in the US doesn’t appear to me to target the main issue they are trying to prevent, school shootings. Red flag laws, universal background checks, waiting periods may keep guns out of the hands of criminals and reduce violent gun deaths over all but they don’t make any progress towards stopping school shootings from ever happening again. I think we can all agree that for the most part the columbine/ sandy hook/ uvalde/ parkland style shootings are the ones that need to stop. The perpetrators of all these shootings are all young men who have never offended before and would not flag any red flag notifications and would pass a background check. Since the school shooting is these individuals first offence it’s likely they are not known to the authorities and thus it is hard to prevent them from getting a weapon under the current system or even with the proposed legislation. One thing that the perpetrators do often have in common is they are often social outcasts with little to no friends and are in some cases even joked about being school shooters by their peers, as was the case in parkland as far as I know. This is where I think a reference of character legislation would be effective. Since these individuals are so young they’ve often never committed a criminal offence so often would have a clean record but, people who know them well would be able to say they should not have a firearm. With a reference of character law someone wishing to buy a gun law would need 3 references from people in their lives who can attest to their character and mental state that they are safe to own a gun. Many of the perpetrators of school shootings would likely have not been able to pass this stage in order to get a gun. To make this law tougher you could specify the references need to be from 3 different aspects of a persons life (educator, friend, family, employer, religious leader, neighbour, etc.) To strengthen the law even further have legal implications for those referees should the gun owner use the weapon to commit a crime.",23,Yeah this is a good idea and I agree it should be a priority for gun control advocates.

I had some vague idea that firearm clubs did exist in some US schools, so I spoke to my uncle about it since he was involved and had an interest in competitive target shooting and hunting from a pretty young age and grew up in the 50s and 60s.

He confirmed that he was part of the rifle club, but he didn’t recollect that anyone brought their own guns to school.  Instead, the rifles used were owned by the school and kept in the basement of the high school.  He explained that target rifles were expensive, so my grandparents (his parents) and his friends’ parents never purchased any and certainly wouldn’t have sent kids with something that expensive on the subway/bus.

Anyways, an anecdote isn’t evidence, but is/was this the typical arrangement for how these clubs functioned?",17,"The high school I graduated from used to have a rifle club only two generations ago. Kids did in fact, bring their rifles to school. They would keep them in the classroom that was assigned to the club.

First let me state that I am in favor of doing anything, and I mean anything to eliminate or minimize gun violence in America.
I am very interested in peoples opinions about comparing the trama associated with today's children having to do active shooter drills in schools to children of the 50s and 60s doing drills in the event of an atomic attack.
Is one more traumatic than the other? Do we just feel like it is because school shootings have happened?

What does Reddit think?",15,"I think it might be an apples and oranges comparison. The idea of nuclear attack was generally terrifying, but it was also a pretty abstract thing to most people. The only place where any real nuclear attacks had ever happened was Japan, and if you lived in the US, you weren't likely to have been exposed to any un-sanitized accounts of what the victims of that attack experienced. On the other hand, we all know what happens when a bullet rips through a body, and we all know how easy it is for people to get guns in the US, even when they're not supposed to have them.

Also, 'duck-and-cover' wasn't likely to do very much to save your life in the event of a nuclear attack anyway. In real life, either you would be far enough from the center of the blast that you would have a chance of surviving, or you would be too close and you would die. Getting under a desk probably wasn't going to make any difference.

The objective of having kids do those nuclear attack drills in the Cold War was most likely to make them *less* terrified by making them think that they had some individual control over the outcome of events, even though they actually didn't. Increased gun control, however, is something that we *could* do, but we just won't."

b1a8v7,I made an essay about gun control for school,BlueDemon278,4,2019-03-15T04:08:27,"i would like opinions on my arguments and to see if you guys agree

&amp;#x200B;

 

In America one of the most problematic issues is gun control. Since 2009, America has suffered 288 school shootings while Canada has only suffered two. Side by side, a pattern seems to emerge, and the only cause visible is the free use of guns. To stop these incidents America needs to change their rules concerning firearms (2nd amendment).  

The 2nd amendment has remained the same since its creation over 200 years ago, as time changes the world does too. Today, our firearms are 10 times more lethal than they were before. We no longer utilize lead balls going 120ft/second, although fast, however, the standard M4, now the most manufactured firearm in the states, and also its national weapon, shoots at 2,970ft/second. To add, they come with a standard magazine size of 30 rounds, of greater accuracy and power, then its ancestor, delivering instead 1 steel pellet of unguaranteed precision and taking minutes to reload. They can be reloaded 10 times faster than a musket and can fire at fully automatic if the shooter chooses to. In summary, our firearms have evolved to be deadlier. And with it, rules ache to also change. 

Accessibility to firearms is also easier than ever before. It is now even possible to go to Walmart or any sports store, answer a couple questions, and have access to basic gun store, nobody checks for the buyer’s background, no one examines or questions the mental state of the client. For example, have you ever been convicted for felony, have you ever been convicted of any kind of assault charges or similar? Even if yes, you are still able to buy from a range of military grade weapons, to pistol to an automatic ak-47, and even explosives. Even if stopped by some state’s laws, you can buy a gun from another person, family member, friend, acquaintance, and even the light black market.  

To conclude, some firearms should be banned, any and all automatic assault rifle, Fast fire rate shotguns and handguns should be banned, any kind flamethrower (Elon Musk's in particular), for the sole reason that they are to be considered overkill. A single shot to the head with a 9mm pistol can kill someone, So there is no need for a fully automatic 5.56 mm assault rifle that could possibly shoot dozens in seconds, and keep going in such a short time after running out of munition in the magazine. Only the police and military should be allowed to use them. But the general public is too uncontrollable if not under strict laws and official enforcement, so it should not be allowed for them to gain access to military grade weaponry. 

Finishing this off, I do not demand to ban guns completely, I only demand to strengthen the laws to accommodate the modern standards of living and the dangers of the civil and open world ",15,"All argument essays need: thesis, arguments for thesis,  address counter arguments against thesis, summary.

Your thesis is weak in the intro. Change 2nd ammendment how and gun laws how? It is stronger in the conclusion but only barely: you talk about automatics, flame throwers, semi auto pistols and rifles... what are you arguing for? (Btw automatics are already pretty much banned for normal ppl who don't have tens of thousands of dollars and no flamethrower has been used in a crime in recent history.) Be very specific and clear with your thesis.

Your arguments need to build and support your thesis. You say a single bullet can kill but also say you don't want to ban guns. If a single bullet can kill shouldn't you want to ban all guns? Since you dont want to ban all guns and automatics are nearly impossible to get, your only argument left is to restrict or ban semi autos. Focus on that.

And the single bullet killing is the basis of dealing with counterarguments. Argue why we shouldnt just ban all guns like Japan does.

Also argue against the argument that all guns should be legal as per 2nd ammendment.

Good luck."

Let us use the ""car"" example that the gun freaks are so fond of, but in a different way.

If I am harmed or if I harm others because a car manufacturer didn't install a working safety device, the manufacturer is liable for the injuries and/or deaths caused by this.

However!  If I drive my car at high speed - purposely - into a crowd of people and kill a couple of dozen of them, the car manufacturer isn't responsible for MY misuse of THEIR product.

The same holds true for guns - much as I loathe admitting this.  If a gun manufacturer neglects to install a working safety mechanism, then they are certainly responsible for any harm that gun causes.  But if I buy a properly-functioning gun and use it to shoot up a classroom of students, the manufacturer is not responsible for my misuse if their product.  Neither is the ammo company responsible for what I did.

Much as I'd like to see somebody held accountable for the misuse of guns in this country, we can't put it onto the gun makers.  We can tax the shit out of their products and those of the bullet-makers.  We can put restrictions of where those products may be used, how they're stored, transported, carried, and put limitations on things like magazine capacities and bullet energies - but Hillary knows that this position can't be enforced.  The courts have ruled over and over on these issues already.

She's pandering.
